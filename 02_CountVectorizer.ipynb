PROSPECTUS     3,375,000 Shares for Sale by 10sion Holdings, Inc. at a price of $4.00 per share  and  1,225,000 Shares of Common Stock as a Dividend to Stockholders of Sixty Six Oilfield Services, Inc.     This prospectus covers two distributions: (a) the sale of 3,375,000 shares by 10sion Holdings at a price of $4.00 per share on a self-underwritten best efforts, all or none basis, the net proceeds from the sale of such shares being used to and in connection with purchase two companies,– See, “How We Intend To Use The Net Proceeds From The Sale Of Our Shares”; and, (b) distribution of 1,225,000 shares of 10sion Holdings’ common stock to the stockholders of Sixty Six Oilfield Services, Inc., subject to 10sion Holdings’ acquisition of an operating subsidiary of Sixty Six Oilfield Services. – See, “How Our Shares Will Be Distributed By Sixty Six Oilfield Services”.     10sion Holdings has determined the initial public offering price of its shares offered for sale for cash pursuant to this prospectus and the value of the shares to be issued to Sixty Six Oilfield Services arbitrarily, and the price and value bear no relationship to asset, earnings, or other criterion of value. See, “How We Have Set The Initial Price To The Public And Value Of Our Shares”. 10sion Holdings will receive the net proceeds from the sale of the shares for cash. Pending 10sion Holdings’ sale of all the shares, gross proceeds will be deposited in an escrow account held by a financial institution to be determined. In the event 10sion Holdings is not able to sell all the shares within the ninety-day period following the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, subject to up to two extensions of ninety days each at the election of 10sion Holdings, all proceeds as received will be promptly refunded to subscribers without interest, offset or deduction. 10sion Holdings and Sixty Six Oilfield Service will not receive any proceeds from the distribution of the 1,225,000 shares by Sixty Six Oilfield Services as a dividend to its stockholders. Sixty Six Oilfield Services distributing and its stockholders reselling the 1,225,000 shares may be deemed statutory underwriters of the 1,225,000 shares.     At the date of this prospectus, there is no public market for 10sion Holdings common stock. 10sion Holdings plans to apply to FINRA for a trading symbol of 10SN which is expected to be issued upon successful completion of the sale of 3,375,000 shares for cash in the self-underwritten best efforts, all or none offering made by this prospectus. You have no assurance that 10sion Holdings will be able to sell all 3,375,000 shares covered by this prospectus, how long it will take to sell all of the shares, if any are sold, or that the common stock will ever be quoted or actively traded in the public securities markets. If 10sion Holdings does not sell all 3,375,000 shares offered by this prospectus, it will not acquire the subsidiary of Sixty Six Oilfield Services, which will not distribute the 1,225,000 shares as a dividend to its stockholders, and 10sion Holdings will not become a publicly traded company.     Investment in the shares to be distributed in reliance on this prospectus involves a degree of risk. See, “risk factors”, beginning on page 2.  Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  We are an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“Jobs Act”), and will therefore be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.  Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.                 3,375,000 shares to be offered and sold for cash      Per share      Total      Initial public offering price      $4.00       $13,500,000       Underwriting commissions, discounts and fees (1)      $0.40       $1,350,000       Net proceeds, before expenses to 10sion Holdings      $3.60       $12,150,000             (1)10sion Holdings does not have any arrangements with securities broker-dealers for sale of the shares. Underwriting commissions, discounts and fees are estimated at 10% of gross proceeds. 10sion Holdings will not pay any commissions, or fees with respect to shares sold by its directors and executive officers.

Bland, who is our founder.     Although we were founded for the purpose of acquiring and have entered into a non-binding, conditional letter of intent to acquire a specifically identified Connecticut corporation engaged in digital marketing beginning in 2007, we have decided to acquire the operating subsidiary of Sixty Six Oilfield Services, Inc. (a Nevada corporation publicly traded under the symbol of SSOF), which as of September 21, 2018 has been legally renamed Six Six Five Energy, Inc., and, in connection therewith, also acquire Sixty Six Oilfield Services. We have a legally binding letter of intent subject to conditions to acquire the Fluid End Sales, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, d/b/a Five Star Rig & Supply, which is the operating subsidiary of Sixty Six Oilfield Services for 1,225,000 shares of our common stock which will then be distributed by Sixty Six Oilfield Services as a dividend to its stockholders pursuant to this prospectus. Contemporaneous with our acquisition of Fluid End Sales, we will purchase three million shares of Sixty Six Oilfield Services’ super-voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock for $10,500,000 from management of Fluid End Sales who are also management of Sixty Six Oilfield Services. Our acquisition of Fluid End Sales and our purchase of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock of Sixty Six Oilfield Services depends on our sale of the 3,375,000 shares we are offering pursuant to this prospectus for cash and upon obtaining a debt funding commitment for $27,500,000 for Fluid End Sales’ purchase of six oil drilling rigs for resale. You have no assurance we will sell the 3,375,000 shares we are offering by this prospectus, obtain the required financing commitment or complete the acquisition Fluid End Sales. Because we have no business operations at the date of this prospectus, the business described in this prospectus is the business of Fluid End Sales, who will become our subsidiary if and when our acquisition is completed. Fluid End Sales has a subsidiary, Oklahoma Rig Fabricators LLC. The business of Sixty Six Oilfield Services is conducted entirely in Fluid End Sales and its subsidiary. In connection with the acquisitions, we will issue as additional consideration 4,375,000 shares of our common stock to management of Fluid End Sales/Sixty Six Oilfield Services. See, “Our Planned Acquisitions.”     The current address of our executive offices is 1812 Front Street, Scotch Plains, New Jersey 07076, New Jersey 08820 and our telephone number is 908-908-379-7715. In the event we complete the acquisition of Fluid End Sales, we expect to relocate our executive offices to 30 Knightsbridge Road Piscataway N.J. 08854. The address of our corporate web site is www.the10sn.com. The address of Fluid End Sales’ website is www. fivestarrig.com. You should not deem any of the information at these websites to be part of the disclosures made in this prospectus.     Our financial statements at inception at February 8, 2018 and for the period from inception to June 30, 2018 included elsewhere herein place us within the definition of a “shell company” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933 and we may be deemed to be a “blank check company” by virtue of our intent to make an acquisition with the proceeds from the sale of our shares. We disclaim what we are either a shell company in reliance on footnote 172 in Securities Act Release 33-8869 (December 6, 2007) or a blank check company based on our formation with the intent to acquire a specifically identified business operation, even though we have changed the business operation we now expect to acquire and may never acquire the business operation we originally intended to acquire, even though we have a nonbinding, conditional letter of intent to do so.     HOW WE ARE AFFECTED BY THE JOBS ACT     We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS ACT”). We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:           (a)     the last day of our fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;                    (b)     the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective “initial public offering” registration statement;                    (c)      the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or                    (d)      the date on which we are deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.            1                As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.     We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.     RISK FACTORS     In addition to the forward-looking statements outlined in the preceding topic in this prospectus and other comments regarding assumptions, risks and uncertainties included in the description of our business and elsewhere in this prospectus, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The following risk factors include all known material risks, but do not include factors or risks which may arise or result from general economic conditions that apply to all businesses in general or risks that could apply to any issuer or any offering. Because the dividend of our common stock to be distributed by Sixty Six Oilfield Services will be distributed only upon completion of the acquisition of the operating subsidiary of that company and we have no business at the date of this prospectus and will have only the business arising from such acquisition, the risk factors presented below are based on the assumption that we have completed such acquisition and relate to the business so acquired.     Our acquisition of Fluid End Sales from Sixty Six Oilfield Services for shares of our common stock is subject to additional conditions which you have no assurance we will be able to satisfy. Fluid End Sales is engaged in the oilfield equipment and supply industry.     RISKS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATION:     If we are not able to make future cash payments on purchase money promissory notes, we will not be able to retain ownership of Fluid End Sales and our business will be substantially or entirely damaged by our failure to make the future cash payments.     The terms of our acquisition of Fluid End Sales requires us to purchase Series A-1 Preferred Stock of Sixty Six Oilfield Services from the original owners of Fluid End Sales for a cash payment at closing in the amount of $6,500,000 and delivery of our convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,000,000. The promissory notes will be secured by a pledge of the equity securities of Fluid End Sales and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock of Sixty Six Oilfield Services. In the event of our default in payments of principal and/or interest on the purchase money promissory notes, the holders of the promissory notes may elect to take back the equity securities of Fluid End Sales and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock of Sixty Six Oilfield Services, in which event we would not recover any of the cash paid in the acquisition or on the promissory notes and we would lose the business of Fluid End Sales and control of Sixty Six Oilfield Services. In the event of loss of Fluid End Sales, our business operations and prospects would be materially damaged and you could expect to lose your entire investment in our common stock.            2                We will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company. These costs will adversely impact our results of operations.     As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that a private company does not incur. We estimate these expenses at $100,000 per year. At the date of this prospectus, we do not have the financial resources to absorb these expenses. Even though the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) has as a purpose reducing the cost for some newly reporting issuers, we are uncertain whether the JOBS Act will apply to us and, if it does, the amount of cost reduction we can expect. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and related rules resulted in an increase in costs of maintaining compliance with the public reporting requirements, as well as making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.     Neither we nor Fluid End Sales have established disclosure controls and procedures and controls over financial reporting. Without these controls, we may not accurately account for our financial transactions and report material transactions on a timely basis.     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires public companies to establish disclosure controls and procedures and controls over financial reporting and to periodically assess the effectiveness of the controls and procedures. Establishing and maintaining these controls and procedures is expensive. Satisfying the criteria for adequate controls and procedures is especially difficult for small public companies, such as we are, because limited personnel must perform tasks which should be divided among a greater number of personnel to achieve checks and balances. Without adequate controls and procedures, and periodically assessing the effectiveness of controls and procedures we do establish, you have no assurance that we will timely and accurately report financial and other material information to the public securities markets. Such failures may result in errors in our reports. And, the prospect of such failures and errors due to weaknesses in our controls and procedures may diminish the credibility of our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.     If you invest in our stock, your investment may be disadvantaged by future funding, if we need and are able to obtain it.     To the extent we need and obtain equity funding by issuance of convertible securities or common stock, or common stock purchase options or warrants in connection with either type of funding, you may suffer significant dilution in percentage of ownership and, if such issuances are below the then value of stockholder equity, in stockholder equity per share. Future increases in the number of our shares outstanding will have a negative impact on earnings per share, increasing the earnings we must achieve to sustain higher prices for our common stock. In addition, any debt financing we may secure could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue our business plan, and to pay dividends. You have no assurance we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.     Loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations.     We will be particularly dependent upon our future executive management team who we will employ as a result of our acquisition Fluid End Sales. The termination of one or more members of those teams for any reason in the near future could be expected to have a materially adverse effect on us because we believe Fluid End Sales would be able to employ qualified replacements who would have their level of dedication to, vision for and financial interest in those businesses. Furthermore, it is probable any qualified replacements would require a salary and benefits which can be expected to exceed both the levels of compensation we expect to pay to that team and our financial resources in the foreseeable future.              3                Voting control by management means it is unlikely you and other stockholders will be able to elect our directors and you will have little influence over our management.     Our management owns one million shares of our Series A Super-voting Convertible Preferred Stock and 34,606,250 shares of our common stock, both received as founders’ shares. Our Series A Super-voting Convertible Preferred Stock has the right to vote ninety percent of all votes cast, including votes by common stockholders (who include our management), on any matters presented to stockholders for approval. It also has the right to convert into common stock equal to ninety percent of issued and outstanding common stock determined immediately following such conversion. In the event of our successful acquisition of Fluid End Sales, the common stock owned by our management would increase to 38,981,250 shares from 34,606,250 shares. Non-management and public stockholders would own 5,518,750 shares, composed of dividend shares distributed by Sixty Six Oilfield Services, shares sold pursuant to this prospectus and shares which may be issued to securities broker-dealers as compensation for sale of our shares. Our Articles of Incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting for the election of directors. Any person or group who controls or can obtain more than fifty percent of the votes cast for the election of each director, as does our management, will control the election of all directors and other stockholders will not be able to elect any directors or exert any influence over management decisions. Removal of a director for any reason requires a majority vote of our issued and outstanding shares of preferred and common stock.     If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our ability to implement our business strategy and our operating results will likely be materially adversely affected.     Growth in the business of Fluid End Sales will likely place a significant strain on our and their respective management, administrative, operating and financial infrastructures, which are limited. To manage our and their respective businesses and planned growth effectively, we and they must successfully develop, implement, maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, identify, hire and integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. Our and/or their failure to do so could either limit our growth or cause our or their respective businesses to fail.     RISKS RELATED TO FLUID END SALES AND ITS BUSINESS:     You will not have an opportunity to evaluate audited financial statements of Fluid End Sales before you purchase our shares.     We do not expect to be required by the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 to provide audited financial statements for Fluid End Sales until after we consummate our acquisition of that company. Our management believes Sixty Six Oilfield Services’ unaudited financial statements are not material, since it has no operations apart from Fluid End Sales as its operating subsidiary and a substantial part of its liabilities are due to Mr. Bland’s wholly owned limited liability company, which we expect to be forgiven. You will be entirely dependent upon the evaluation of Fluid End Sales unaudited financial statements for fiscal years 2016, 2017 and year to date by our management and their determination of the merits of us using the net proceeds from your purchase of our shares to facilitate the acquisition of Fluid End Sales by purchasing super-voting preferred stock of Sixty Six Oilfield Services and funding the equity portion needed for Fluid End Sales to purchase and resell six oil drilling rigs.     Fluid End Sales anticipates an increase in costs of raw materials, specifically steel, and of finished goods Fluid End Sales purchases as components of its products and for resale due to tariffs recently place on imported steel by the federal government will have an adverse impact on Fluid End Sales’ sales.     Fluid End Sales’ products are almost entirely manufactured from steel, and a significant amount of the steel Fluid End Sales use as raw materials and finished components is imported from outside the United States. Fluid End Sales anticipates its cost of goods will increase as a result of tariffs on steel imports recently imposed by the federal government. You have no assurance Fluid End Sales will be able recover such increase costs in the pricing of its products, that any such increased pricing intended to offset increased costs will not make its products less attractive and competitive in foreign markets or that its foreign customers will no divert their business to foreign suppliers in protest against such increased tariffs. Fluid End Sales’ increased pricing as a consequence of increased costs and the reaction of its customers which are beyond its control could be expected to have an adverse effect on its revenues and profitability.            4                A substantial decrease in the price of steel could significantly lower Fluid End Sales product margin or cash flow.     Fluid End Sales distribute many products manufactured from steel. As a result, the price and supply of steel can affect its business and, in particular, Fluid End Sales’ pipe product category. When steel prices are lower, the prices that Fluid End Sales charges customers for products may decline, which affects Fluid End Sales product margin and cash flow. At times pricing and availability of steel can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond Fluid End Sales’ control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, consolidation of steel producers, fluctuations in and the costs of raw materials necessary to produce steel, steel manufacturers’ plant utilization levels and capacities, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. Increases in manufacturing capacity steel-related products could put pressure on the prices Fluid End Sales receives for such products. When steel prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and Fluid End Sales’ competitors’ responses to those demands could result in lower sales prices and, consequently, lower product margin and cash flow.     If steel prices rise, Fluid End Sales may be unable to pass along the cost increases to Fluid End Sales’ customers.     Fluid End Sales maintains inventories of steel products to accommodate the lead time requirements of its customers. Accordingly, Fluid End Sales purchases steel products in an effort to maintain its inventory at levels that Fluid End Sales believes to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of Fluid End Sales’ customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers and market conditions. Fluid End Sales’ commitments to purchase steel products are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time Fluid End Sales places orders. If steel prices increase between the time Fluid End Sales orders steel products and the time of delivery of the products to Fluid End Sales, Fluid End Sales’ suppliers may impose surcharges that require it to pay for increases in steel prices during the period. Demand for the products Fluid End Sales distributes, the actions of its competitors and other factors will influence whether Fluid End Sales will be able to pass on steel cost increases and surcharges to its customers, and it may be unsuccessful in doing so.     If tariffs and duties on imports into the U.S. of line pipe or certain of the other products that Fluid End Sales sells are lifted, Fluid End Sales could have too many of these products in inventory competing against less expensive imports.     U.S. law currently imposes tariffs and duties on imports from certain foreign countries of line pipe and, to a lesser extent, on imports of certain other products that Fluid End Sales sells. If these tariffs and duties are lifted or reduced or if the level of these imported products otherwise increases, and Fluid End Sales’ U.S. customers accept these imported products, Fluid End Sales could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that Fluid End Sales would then have higher-cost products in Fluid End Sales’ inventory or increased supplies of these products which would drive down prices and margins. If prices of these products were to decrease significantly, Fluid End Sales might not be able to profitably sell these products, and the value of Fluid End Sales’ inventory would decline. In addition, significant price decreases could result in a significantly longer holding period for some of Fluid End Sales’ inventory.     Decreased capital and other expenditures in the energy industry, which can result from decreased oil and natural gas prices, among other things, can adversely impact Fluid End Sales’ customers’ demand for its products and revenue.     Fluid End Sales’ revenue depends upon the level of capital and operating expenditures in the oil and natural gas industry, including capital and other expenditures in connection with exploration, drilling, production, gathering, transportation, refining and processing operations. Demand for the products Fluid End Sales distributes is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital and other expenditures by, oil and natural gas companies. In addition, after a well is drilled, there can be a lag between when the well is drilled and when it is completed, which causes a delay in the demand for some of Fluid End Sale’s products. Oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile since 2014. Continued volatility and weakness in oil or natural gas prices could depress levels of exploration, development and production activity and, therefore, could lead to a decrease in Fluid End Sales’ customers’ capital and other expenditures.              5                The willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital and operating expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital and operating equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which Fluid End Sales has no control, including:                 ●     the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits, the level of production by non-OPEC countries and worldwide demand for oil and gas;                                ●     the level of production from known reserves;                                ●     the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas;                                ●     the level of drilling activity and drilling rig day rates;                                ●     worldwide economic activity;                                ●     national government political requirements;                                ●     the development of alternate energy sources; and                                ●     environmental regulations.     If there is a significant reduction in demand for drilling services, in cash flows of drilling contractors, well servicing companies or production companies, or in drilling or well servicing rig utilization rates, then demand for Fluid End Sales’ products will decline.     Volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for Fluid End Sales’ products.     Demand for Fluid End Sales’ products is largely determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices, and the related spending and level of activity by Fluid End Sales’ customers, including spending on production and the level of drilling activities. Volatility or weakness in oil or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending pattern of Fluid End Sales’ customers, and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for Fluid End Sales’ products. Any sustained decrease in capital expenditures in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales.     Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond Fluid End Sales’ control. Crude oil prices declined significantly starting in 2014, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil spot prices declining from a high of $108 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016. In 2016, customers continued to make downward revisions to their operating budgets while Crude prices averaged just under $40 per barrel. Crude prices rose in 2017 to average just over $53 per barrel which brought stability to exploration and production budgets for large and midsize producers who averaged 100,000 to over 1MM per day in production. Crude prices have continued to rise in 2018 to an average of just over $60 per barrel. While Crude prices have steadily risen for the last 18-20 months there is no indication that the per-barrel prices will continue to rise or stay above $50 per barrel which for many producers is a breakeven exploration and drilling base. Accordingly, any drop in Crude prices for an extended period of time below $40 would adversely impact the demand for Fluid End Sales’ products. Any such reduction in operating budgets, reduction in activity and/or pricing pressures, would adversely affect Fluid End Sales ‘ revenue and operating performance.     Many factors affect the supply of and demand for energy and, therefore, influence oil and natural gas prices, including:                 ●     the level of domestic and worldwide oil and natural gas production and inventories;                                ●     the level of drilling activity and the availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which governmental actions may affect, such as regulatory actions or legislation, or other restrictions on drilling, including those related to environmental concerns (e.g., a temporary moratorium on deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following a rig accident or oil spill);                                ●     the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves and the expected cost of developing new reserves;                                ●     the actual cost of finding and producing oil and natural gas;                                ●     depletion rates;                                ●     domestic and worldwide refinery over capacity or under capacity and utilization rates;                                ●     the availability of transportation infrastructure and refining capacity;                                ●     increases in the cost of products that the oil and gas industry uses, such as those that Fluid End Sales provides, which may result from increases in the cost of raw materials such as steel;                                ●     shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;                                ●     the economic or political attractiveness of alternative fuels, such as coal, hydrocarbon, battery power, wind, solar energy and biomass-based fuels;              6                            ●     increases in oil and natural gas prices or historically high oil and natural gas prices, which could lower demand for oil and natural gas products;                                ●     worldwide economic activity including growth in non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) countries, including China and India;                                ●     interest rates and the cost of capital;                                ●     national government policies, including government policies that could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas, E&P, refining or transportation assets;                                ●     the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil;                                ●     the level of production by non-OPEC countries;                                ●     the impact of armed hostilities, or the threat or perception of armed hostilities;                                ●     environmental regulation;                                ●     technological advances;                                ●     global weather conditions and natural disasters;                                ●     currency fluctuations; and                                ●     tax policies.     Oil and natural gas prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. U.S. rig count increased from 665 rigs on January 6, 2017 to 929 rigs on December 29, 2017. U.S. rig count averaged 875 rigs in 2017. U.S. rig count at June 29, 2018 was 1,047 and on September 7, 2018 was 1,048. The price for WTI crude was $67.75 per barrel at September 7, 2018. The price for WTI crude was $52.36 per barrel on January 3, 2017 and $36.81 per barrel on January 4, 2016 and $61.98 on January 4, 2018. This type of volatility has historically caused oil and natural gas companies to change their strategies and expenditure levels from year to year. Fluid End Sales has experienced in the past, and Fluid End Sales will likely experience in the future, significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes.     General economic conditions may adversely affect Fluid End Sales’ business.     U.S. and global general economic conditions affect many aspects of Fluid End Sales’ business, including demand for the products Fluid End Sales distributes and the pricing and availability of supplies. General economic conditions and predictions regarding future economic conditions also affect Fluid End Sales’ forecasts. A decrease in demand for the products Fluid End Sales distributes or other adverse effects resulting from an economic downturn may cause Fluid End Sales to fail to achieve its anticipated financial results. General economic factors beyond Fluid End Sales’ control that affect its business and customers include interest rates, recession, inflation, deflation, customer credit availability, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, performance of housing markets, energy costs, tax rates and policy, unemployment rates, commencement or escalation of war or hostilities, the threat or possibility of war, terrorism or other global or national unrest, political or financial instability, and other matters that influence its customers’ spending. Increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency or increase in magnitude. In addition, worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on Fluid End Sales’ business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.     Fluid End Sales may be unable to compete successfully with other companies in its industry.     Fluid End Sales sells products in very competitive markets. In some cases, Fluid End Sales competes with large companies with substantial resources. In other cases, Fluid End Sales competes with smaller regional companies that may increasingly be willing to provide similar products at lower prices. Certain of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than Fluid End Sales does, and may be in a better competitive position. The following competitive actions can each adversely affect Fluid End Sales’ revenues and earnings:                 ●     price changes;                                ●     vendors with better terms;                                ●     consolidation in the industry;                                 ●     investments in technology and fulfillment; and                                ●     improvements in availability and delivery.            7                Fluid End Sales could experience a material adverse effect to the extent that its competitors are successful in reducing its customers’ purchases of products from Fluid End Sales. Competition could also cause Fluid End Sales to lower its prices, which could reduce its margins and profitability. Furthermore, consolidation in Fluid End Sales’ industry could heighten the impacts of the competition on its business and results of operations discussed above, particularly if consolidation results in competitors with stronger financial and strategic resources, and could also result in increases to the prices Fluid End Sales is required to pay for acquisitions it may make in the future. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions and government-owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which Fluid End Sales operates have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages. Competition in Fluid End Sales’ industry could lead to lower revenues and earnings.     Demand for the products Fluid End Sales distributes could decrease if the manufacturers of those products were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to end users in the sectors Fluid End Sales serves.     Historically, users of drilling rigs, pipes, valves and fittings and related products have purchased certain amounts of these products through distributors and not directly from manufacturers. If customers were to purchase the products that Fluid End Sales sells directly from manufacturers, or if manufacturers sought to increase their efforts to sell directly to end users, Fluid End Sales could experience a significant decrease in profitability. These or other developments that remove Fluid End Sales from, or limit its role in, the distribution chain, may harm its competitive position in the marketplace and reduce its sales and earnings and adversely affect its business.     Fluid End Sales may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.     Fluid End Sales e may require more capital in the future to:                 ●     fund its operations (including, but not limited to, working capital requirements such as inventory);                                ●     finance investments in equipment and infrastructure needed to maintain and expand its distribution capabilities;                                ●     enhance and expand the range of products Fluid End Sales offers; and                                ●     respond to potential strategic opportunities, such as investments, acquisitions and international expansion.     You have no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to Fluid End Sales, or at all. The terms of available financing may place limits on Fluid End Sales’ financial and operating flexibility. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, Fluid End Sales may be forced to reduce Fluid End Sales’ operations or delay, limit or abandon expansion opportunities. Moreover, even if Fluid End Sales is able to continue its operations, the failure to obtain additional financing could reduce its competitiveness.     Fluid End Sales may experience unexpected supply shortages.     Fluid End Sales distributes products from a wide variety of manufacturers and suppliers. Nevertheless, in the future Fluid End Sales may have difficulty obtaining the products its need from suppliers and manufacturers as a result of unexpected demand or production difficulties that might extend lead times. Also, products may not be available to Fluid End Sales in quantities sufficient to meet its customer demand. Fluid End Sales inability to obtain products from suppliers and manufacturers in sufficient quantities, or at all, could adversely affect its product offerings and its business.     Fluid End Sales may experience cost increases from suppliers, which it may be unable to pass on to its customers.     In the future, Fluid End Sales may face supply cost increases due to, among other things, unexpected increases in demand for supplies, decreases in production of supplies or increases in the cost of raw materials or transportation. Any inability to pass supply price increases on to its customers could have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales. In addition, if supply costs increase, Fluid End Sales’ customers may elect to purchase smaller amounts of products or may purchase products from other distributors. While Fluid End Sales may be able to work with its customers to reduce the effects of unforeseen price increases because of its relationships with them, it may not be able to reduce the effects of the cost increases. In addition, to the extent that competition leads to reduced purchases of products from Fluid End Sales or a reduction of its prices, and these reductions occur concurrently with increases in the prices for selected commodities which Fluid End Sales uses in its operations, the adverse effects described above would likely be exacerbated and could result in a prolonged downturn in profitability.            8                Fluid End Sales does not have contracts with most of its suppliers. The loss of a significant supplier would require Fluid End Sales to rely more heavily on its other existing suppliers or to develop relationships with new suppliers. Such a loss may have an adverse effect on Fluid End Sales’ product offerings and business.     Given the nature of Fluid End Sales’ business, and consistent with industry practice, Fluid End Sales does not have contracts with most of its suppliers. Fluid End Sales generally make its purchases through purchase orders. Therefore, most of Fluid End Sales’ suppliers have the ability to terminate their relationships with it at any time. Although Fluid End Sales believes there are numerous manufacturers with the capacity to supply the products it distributes, the loss of one or more of its major suppliers could have an adverse effect on Fluid End Sales’ product offerings and business. Such a loss would require Fluid End Sales to rely more heavily on its other existing suppliers or develop relationships with new suppliers, which may cause Fluid End Sales to pay higher prices for products due to, among other things, a loss of volume discount benefits currently obtained from its major suppliers.     Price reductions by suppliers of products that Fluid End Sales sells could cause the value of its inventory to decline. Also, these price reductions could cause customers to demand lower sales prices for these products, possibly decreasing its margins and profitability on sales to the extent that Fluid End Sales purchased its inventory of these products at the higher prices prior to supplier price reductions.     The value of Fluid End Sales’ inventory could decline as a result of manufacturer price reductions with respect to products that it sells. There is no assurance that a substantial decline in product prices would not result in a write-down of its inventory value. Such a write-down could have an adverse effect on its financial condition. Also, decreases in the market prices of products that it sells could cause customers to demand lower sales prices from Fluid End Sales. These price reductions could reduce Fluid End Sales’ margins and profitability on sales with respect to the lower-priced products. Reductions in margins and profitability on sales could have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales.     Fluid End Sales does not have long-term contracts or agreements with many of its customers. The contracts and agreements that it does have generally do not commit its customers to any minimum purchase volume. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales.     Given the nature of Fluid End Sales’ business, and consistent with industry practice, it does not have long-term contracts with many of its customers. In addition, its contracts generally do not commit its customers to any minimum purchase volume. Therefore, a significant number of its customers may terminate their relationships with Fluid End Sales or reduce their purchasing volume at any time. Furthermore, the long-term customer contracts that Fluid End Sales does have are generally terminable without cause on short notice. Fluid End Sales’ thirty largest customers, in aggregate, represented approximately one-third of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. The products that Fluid End Sales may sell to any particular customer depend in large part on the size of that customer’s capital expenditure budget in a particular year and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a customer that accounts for a significant portion of its sales in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of its sales in subsequent fiscal years. The loss of a significant customer, or a substantial decrease in a significant customer’s orders, may have an adverse effect on Fluid End Sales’ sales and revenue. In addition, Fluid End Sales is subject to customer audit clauses in many of its multi-year contracts. If Fluid End Sales is not able to provide the proper documentation or support for invoices per the contract terms, it may be subject to negotiated settlements with its major customers.     Changes in Fluid End Sales’ customer and product mix could cause its product margin to fluctuate.     From time to time, Fluid End Sales may experience changes in its customer mix or in its product mix. Changes in its customer mix may result from geographic expansion, daily selling activities within current geographic markets and targeted selling activities to new customer segments. Changes in Fluid End Sales’ product mix may result from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to Fluid End Sales from existing and prospective customers. If customers begin to require more lower-margin products from Fluid End Sales and fewer higher-margin products, its business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.            9                Customer credit risks could result in losses.     The concentration of Fluid End Sales’ customers in the energy industry may impact its overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Further, laws in some jurisdictions in which Fluid End Sales operates could make collection difficult or time consuming. Fluid End Sales’ performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and do not generally require collateral in support of its trade receivables. While Fluid End Sales maintains reserves for expected credit losses, it cannot assure these reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that its losses from such receivables will be consistent with its expectations.     Fluid End Sales is a holding company and depend upon its subsidiaries for its cash flow.     Fluid End Sales is a holding company. Its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own substantially all of its assets. Consequently, its cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations or to make other distributions in the future will depend upon the cash flow of its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries’ payment of funds to it in the form of dividends, tax sharing payments or otherwise. The ability of Fluid End Sales’ subsidiaries to make any payments to it will depend on their earnings, the terms of their current and future indebtedness, tax considerations and legal and contractual restrictions on the ability to make distributions. Fluid End Sales’ subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Any right that Fluid End Sales has to receive any assets of or distributions from any of its subsidiaries upon the bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization, or to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be junior to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt that the subsidiary issued.     Changes in Fluid End Sales’ credit profile may affect its relationship with its suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity.     Changes in Fluid End Sales’ credit profile may affect the way its suppliers view its ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices. Given the large dollar amounts and volume of its purchases from suppliers, a change in payment terms may have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its ability to make payments to its suppliers and, consequently, may have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales.     Fluid End Sales is subject to strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may lead to significant liabilities and negatively impact the demand for its products.     Fluid End Sales is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental, health and safety laws; regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing the discharge of pollutants or hazardous substances into the air, soil or water, the generation, handling, use, management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes, the responsibility to investigate and clean up contamination and occupational health and safety. Regulations and courts may impose fines and penalties for non-compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. Fluid End Sales failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions.     Certain laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or the “U.S. federal Superfund law”) or its state and foreign equivalents, may impose the obligation to investigate and remediate contamination at a facility on current and former owners or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal. These laws and regulations may impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination.            10                Moreover, Fluid End Sales may incur liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to Fluid End Sales relating to its existing, prior or future owned or leased sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities it may have assumed or acquired. Fluid End Sales believes that indemnities contained in certain of its acquisition agreements may cover certain environmental conditions existing at the time of the acquisition, subject to certain terms, limitations and conditions. However, if these indemnification provisions terminate or if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their indemnification obligations, Fluid End Sales may be subject to liability with respect to the environmental matters that those indemnification provisions address. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to its business and the business of its customers, including laws regulating the energy industry, and the interpretation or enforcement of these laws and regulations, are constantly evolving. It is impossible to predict accurately the effect that changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have on Fluid End Sales. Should environmental laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, its costs, or the costs of its customers, could increase, which may have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales.     Fluid End Sales may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities, including liabilities arising from litigation.     In the ordinary course of business, Fluid End Sales has and in the future may become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning its commercial operations, the products Fluid End Sales distributes, employees and other matters, including potential claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of the products Fluid End Sales distributes or its operations. Some of these claims may relate to the activities of businesses that Fluid End Sales has acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to its acquisition of the businesses. The products Fluid End Sales distributes are sold primarily for use in the energy industry, which is subject to inherent risks that could result in death, personal injury, property damage, pollution, release of hazardous substances or loss of production. In addition, defects in the products it distribute could result in death, personal injury, property damage, pollution, release of hazardous substances or damage to equipment and facilities. Actual or claimed defects in the products Fluid End Sales distributes may give rise to claims against it for losses and expose it to claims for damages.     Fluid End Sales maintains insurance to cover certain of its potential losses, and it is subject to various self-retentions, deductibles and caps under its insurance. Fluid End Sales faces the following risks with respect to its insurance coverage:                 ●     it may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;                                ●     it may incur losses from interruption of its business that exceed its insurance coverage;                                ●     it may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by its insurance;                                ●     its insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or                                ●     the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed its policy limits.     Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales. Finally, even in cases where Fluid End Sales maintains insurance coverage, its insurers may raise various objections and exceptions to coverage that could make uncertain the timing and amount of any possible insurance recovery.     Due to its position as a distributor, Fluid End Sales is subject to personal injury, product liability and environmental claims involving allegedly defective products.     Fluid End Sales’ customers use certain products it distributes in potentially hazardous applications that can result in personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where end users use the products it distributes may result in Fluid End Sales being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims, even though Fluid End Sales did not manufacture the products. Applicable law may render Fluid End Sales liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault. In particular, certain environmental laws provide for joint and several and strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. Certain of these risks are reduced by the fact that Fluid End Sales is a distributor of products that third-party manufacturers produce, and, thus, in certain circumstances, Fluid End Sales may have third-party warranty or other claims against the manufacturer of products alleged to have been defective. However, you have no assurance that these claims could fully protect Fluid End Sales or that the manufacturer would be able financially to provide protection. You have no assurance that Fluid End Sales’ insurance coverage will be adequate to cover the underlying claims. Fluid End Sales’ insurance does not provide coverage for all liabilities (including liability for certain events involving pollution or other environmental claims).            11                If Fluid End Sales loses any of its key personnel, it may be unable to effectively manage its business or continue its growth.     Fluid End Sales’ future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its management team and its ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, sales and marketing personnel. In particular, Fluid End Sales relies on its sales and marketing teams to create innovative ways to generate demand for the products it distribute. The loss or unavailability to Fluid End Sales of any member of its management team or a key sales or marketing employee could have a material adverse effect on Fluid End Sales to the extent Fluid End Sales is unable to timely find adequate replacements. Fluid End Sales faces competition for these professionals from its competitors, its customers and other companies operating in its industry. Fluid End Sales may be unsuccessful in attracting, hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel.     Interruptions in the proper functioning of Fluid End Sales information systems could disrupt operations and cause increases in costs or decreases in revenues.     The proper functioning of Fluid End Sales’ information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business. Fluid End Sales depends on its information management systems to process orders, track credit risk, manage inventory and monitor accounts receivable collections. Fluid End Sales’ information systems also allow it to efficiently purchase products from its vendors and ship products to its customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide superior service to its customers. However, Fluid End Sales’ information systems could be vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures, security breaches and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, its ability to procure products to sell, process and ship customer orders, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable and pay accounts payable and expenses could be adversely affected. Fluid End Sales ability to integrate its systems with its customers’ systems would also be significantly affected. Fluid End Sales maintains information systems controls designed to protect against, among other things, unauthorized program changes and unauthorized access to data on its information systems. If Fluid End Sales’ information systems controls do not function properly, Fluid End Sales could face increased risks of unexpected errors and unreliable financial data or theft of proprietary information.     The loss of third-party transportation providers upon whom Fluid End Sales depends, or conditions negatively affecting the transportation industry, could increase its costs or cause a disruption in its operations.     Fluid End Sales depends upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of products to its customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service, increases in fuel prices and adverse weather conditions, could increase its costs and disrupt its operations and its ability to service its customers on a timely basis. Fluid End Sales cannot predict whether or to what extent increases or anticipated increases in fuel prices may impact its costs or cause a disruption in its operations going forward.     Adverse weather events or natural disasters could negatively affect local economies and disrupt operations.     Certain areas in which Fluid End Sales operates are susceptible to adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes. These events can disrupt Fluid End Sales’ operations, result in damage to its properties and negatively affect the local economies in which it operates. Additionally, Fluid End Sales may experience communication disruptions with its customers, vendors and employees. These events can cause physical damage to its locations and require Fluid End Sales to close locations. Additionally, Fluid End Sales’ sales orders and shipments can experience a temporary decline immediately following these events.            12                Fluid End Sales cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by these events will affect its operations or the economies in regions where it operates. These adverse events could result in disruption of Fluid End Sales’ purchasing or distribution capabilities, interruption of its business that exceeds its insurance coverage, its inability to collect from customers and increased operating costs. Fluid End Sales’ business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of these events.     Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect Fluid End Sales’ tax obligations and effective tax rate.     The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how Fluid End Sales will apply the law and impact its results of operations in the period issued. The Act requires complex computations not previously provided in U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the Act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As a result, Fluid End Sales has provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Act in its financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as it performs additional analysis on the application of the law, and as Fluid End Sales refines estimates in calculating the effect, its final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from its current provisional amounts, which could materially affect its tax obligations and effective tax rate.     Fluid End Sales faces risks associated with conducting business in markets outside of the U.S. and Canada.     Fluid End Sales currently conducts business in countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. Fluid End Sales could be materially and adversely affected by economic, legal, political and regulatory developments in the countries in which it does business in the future or in which it expands business, particularly those countries which have historically experienced a high degree of political or economic instability. Examples of risks inherent in conducting business in markets outside of the U.S. and Canada include:                 ●     changes in the political and economic conditions in the countries in which Fluid End Sales operates, including civil uprisings and terrorist acts;                                ●     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;                                ●     changes in tariffs;                                ●     the adoption of foreign or domestic laws limiting exports to or imports from certain foreign countries;                                ●     fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar;                                ●     restrictions on repatriation of earnings;                                ●     expropriation of property without fair compensation;                                ●     governmental actions that result in the deprivation of contract or proprietary rights; and                                ●     the acceptance of business practices which are not consistent with or are antithetical to prevailing business practices Fluid End Sales is accustomed to in North America including export compliance and anti-bribery practices and governmental sanctions.     If Fluid End Sales begins doing business in a foreign country in which it does not presently operate, Fluid End Sales may also face difficulties in operations and diversion of management time in connection with establishing its business there.              13                Fluid End Sales subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions, and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where Fluid End Sales operates. Fluid End Sales’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject it to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm its reputation.     Doing business on a worldwide basis requires Fluid End Sales to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on its operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, Fluid End Sales’ operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, Fluid End Sales is exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.     The FCPA prohibits Fluid End Sales from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires Fluid End Sales to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s transactions. As part of Fluid End Sales’ business, Fluid End Sales may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act (the “Bribery Act”) has been enacted and came into effect on July 1, 2011. The provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Some of the international locations in which Fluid End Sales operates lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Fluid End Sales’ continued expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, and its development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future.     Economic sanctions programs restrict Fluid End Sales’ business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because Fluid End Sales acts as a distributor, it faces the risk that its customers might further distribute its products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject it to an investigation concerning compliance with the OFAC or other sanctions regulations.     Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. Fluid End Sales has established policies and procedures designed to assist its compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act and trade controls and sanctions programs administered by the OFAC, and have trained its employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, you have no assurance that all of its employees, consultants, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of its policies and these laws and regulations, and that its policies and procedures will effectively prevent Fluid End Sales from violating these regulations in every transaction in which it may engage or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, Fluid End Sales may be held liable for the actions that its local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though its partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if its policies prohibit it, could have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business with sanctioned countries, persons and entities.     The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in Fluid End Sales’ cybersecurity, could negatively impact Fluid End Sales’ business by causing a disruption to its operations, a compromise or corruption of its confidential information or damage to Fluid End Sales’ image, all of which could negatively impact its financial results.     A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Fluid End Sales’ information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information. As Fluid End Sales’ reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those it has outsourced. Fluid End Sales’ three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to Fluid End Sales’ image, and private data exposure. Fluid End Sales has implemented solutions, processes, and procedures to help mitigate this risk, but these measures, as well as its organization’s increased awareness of its risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that its financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.            14                Compliance with and changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which Fluid End Sales operates could have a significant financial impact and effect how and where it conducts its operations.     Fluid End Sales has operations in the U.S. and in other countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the business and legal environments in the countries in which it operates. Compliance with and changes in laws, regulations, and other legal and business issues could impact its ability to manage its costs and to meet its earnings goals. Compliance related matters could also limit its ability to do business in certain countries. Changes that could have a significant cost to Fluid End Sales include new legislation, new regulations, or a differing interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in tax law or tax rates, the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, the expansion of currency exchange controls, export controls or additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions in which Fluid End Sales operates or intend to operate.     Changes in the United Kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect Fluid End Sales.      In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw, and withdrawal negotiations began in June 2017. European Union rules provide for a two-year negotiation period, beginning on the withdrawal notification date, unless an extension is agreed to by the parties. The negotiations between the parties have yet to produce an overall structure for their ongoing relationship following Brexit. Fluid End Sales has joint ventures and volume pricing agreements with suppliers, manufacturers and wholesalers in both the United Kingdom and the European Union. The ongoing uncertainty and potential re-imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union nations could negatively impact its competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance. The ultimate effects of Brexit on Fluid End Sales will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the United Kingdom and the European Union reach to provide access to each other’s respective markets.

Business Overview     We are an insurance holding company specialized in providing personal property insurance in coastal markets including those in Louisiana, Texas and Florida. These markets are characterized by smaller regional insurers controlling larger market shares than in other, less catastrophe-exposed markets. These markets are also characterized by state-administered residual insurers controlling large market shares. These unique markets can trace their roots to Hurricane Andrew, after which larger national carriers limited their capital allocation and approaches to property risk aggregation. These trends accelerated again after back to back exceptionally active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. However, the decade following the 2005 Hurricane Katrina had relatively few losses arising from tropical storm activity which led to declines in reinsurance pricing and dramatic increases in its availability. We were incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware to take advantage of these favorable dynamics where premium could be acquired relatively more quickly and under less competitive pressure than in other property insurance markets and reinsurance, the largest single expense, was declining from record high levels. We execute on this opportunity via a management team with expertise in the critical facets of our business: underwriting, claims, reinsurance, and operations. Within our broad three-state market, we seek to sell our products in territories with the highest rate per exposure and the least complexity in terms of risk. Further, we seek to leverage our increasingly geographically diverse insurance portfolio to gain efficiencies with respect to reinsurance. As of December 31, 2017 we insure approximately 50,000 homes, an increase of almost 48% from one year prior.               1                     On November 19, 2013, we changed our legal name to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and on March 31, 2014, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Prior to March 31, 2014, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America Inc., which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services Inc., or KFSI, a publicly owned holding company based in Canada. As of the date of this prospectus, KFSI and its affiliates beneficially own approximately 8.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock and warrants and performance shares to acquire approximately an additional 23.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, as of the date of this prospectus, Fundamental Global Investors, LLC and its affiliates, or FGI, beneficially own approximately 36.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock. D. Kyle Cerminara, a member of our Board of Directors, serves as Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of FGI, and Lewis M. Johnson, a member of our Board of Directors, serves as President, Co-Founder and Partner of FGI.     We have three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Maison Insurance Company, or Maison, Maison Managers Inc., or MMI, and ClaimCor, LLC, or ClaimCor.     Through Maison, we began providing property and casualty insurance to individuals in Louisiana in December 2012. In September 2015, Maison began writing manufactured home policies in Texas on a direct basis. Our current insurance offerings in Louisiana and Texas include homeowners insurance, manufactured home insurance and dwelling fire insurance. We write both full peril property policies as well as wind/hail only exposures and we produce new policies through a network of independent insurance agencies. We refer to the policies that we write through these independent agencies as voluntary policies. We also write commercial business in Texas through a quota-share agreement with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company, or Brotherhood. Through this agreement, we have assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout Texas.     In addition to the voluntary policies that Maison writes, we have participated in the last six rounds of take-outs from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, or LA Citizens, occurring on December 1st of each year, as well as the inaugural depopulation of policies from the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association, or TWIA, which occurred on December 1, 2016. Under these programs, state-approved insurance companies, such as Maison, have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by LA Citizens and TWIA. The majority of policies that we have obtained through LA Citizens as well as all of the policies we have obtained through TWIA cover losses arising only from wind and hail. Prior to our take-out, many of LA Citizens and TWIA policyholders were not able to obtain such coverage from any other marketplace.     On March 1, 2017, Maison received a certificate of authority from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, or FOIR, which authorized Maison to write personal lines insurance in Florida. Pursuant to the Consent Order issued, Maison has agreed to comply with certain requirements as outlined by the FOIR until Maison can demonstrate three consecutive years of net income following our admission into Florida as evidenced by its Annual Statement filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. To comply with a requirement of the consent order that Maison have at least $35 million in capital and surplus, and maintain an RBC ratio of 300% or more, on March 31, 2017, Maison received a capital contribution from PIH in the amount of $16 million.     On September 29, 2017, Maison received authorization from the FOIR to assume personal lines policies from Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“FL Citizens”) pursuant to a proposal of depopulation which Maison filed with FL Citizens on August 18, 2017. Accordingly, Maison entered the Florida market via the assumption of policies from FL Citizens in December, 2017. The order approving Maison’s assumption of policies limits the number of policies which Maison may assume in 2017 to 14,663, and also stipulates that Maison maintain catastrophe reinsurance at such levels as deemed appropriate by the FOIR.     MMI serves as our management services subsidiary, known as a managing general agency, and provides underwriting, policy administration, claims administration, marketing, accounting and other management services to Maison. MMI contracts primarily with independent agencies for policy sales and services, and also contracts with an independent third-party for policy administration services. As a managing general agency, MMI is licensed by and subject to the regulatory oversight of the LDI, TDI and FOIR. MMI earns commissions on a portion of the premiums Maison writes, as well as a per policy fee which ranges from $0-$75 for providing policy administration, marketing, reinsurance contract negotiation and accounting and analytical services.                2                     On January 2, 2015, we completed our acquisition of 100% of the membership interests of ClaimCor, a claims and underwriting technical solutions company. Maison processes claims made by our policyholders through ClaimCor, and also through various third-party claims adjusting companies during times of high volume, so that we may provide responsive claims handling service when catastrophe events occur which impact many of our policyholders. We have the ultimate authority over the claims handling process, while the agencies that we appoint have no authority to settle our claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process.     We have an experienced management team with a collective experience of more than 115 years in the insurance industry. Our executive officers have extensive experience in the property and casualty insurance industry, as well as long-standing relationships with agents and insurance regulators in Louisiana, Texas and Florida.     We currently distribute our insurance policies through a network of independent agents. These agents typically represent several insurance companies in order to provide various insurance product lines to their clients.     As of September 30, 2017, we had total assets of $115.5 million and stockholders’ equity of $45.6 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we had net losses of $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 50,000 policies in-force. Of the approximately 50,000 policies in-force, approximately 34% were obtained from take-out policies from LA and FL Citizens and approximately 66% were voluntary policies obtained from our independent agency force.     Our Corporate Structure     The chart below displays our corporate structure:          The Company was originally incorporated under the name Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. to hold all of the capital stock of two of our subsidiaries, Maison and MMI. We acquired 100% of the membership interests of ClaimCor in January 2015. As a holding company for these subsidiaries, we are subject to regulation by the LDI, TDI and FOIR. As of the date of this prospectus, KFSI and its affiliates beneficially own approximately 8.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock and warrants and performance shares to acquire an additional 23.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock and FGI and its affiliates beneficially own approximately 36.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock.     We are subject to laws and regulations in Louisiana, Texas and Florida, and will be subject to the regulations of any other states in which we may seek to conduct business in the future. In these states, it is the duty of each respective department of insurance to administer the provisions of the insurance code in that state. The purpose of each state’s insurance code is to regulate the insurance industry in all of its phases, including, but not limited to, the following: licensing of insurers and producers, regulation of investments and solvency, review and approval of forms and rates, and market conduct. Furthermore, as Maison is domiciled in the State of Louisiana, the LDI conducts periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of Maison and requires Maison to file financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis.     We believe that our holding company structure gives us flexibility to expand our operations and the products and services we offer. We may diversify our business through existing or newly formed subsidiaries or acquisitions. We may issue additional shares of capital stock or obtain debt financing to fund such diversification.                3                     Competitive Strengths      Since we began operations in December of 2012, our growth has been due to our competitive strengths, which include:        ●Our                                          knowledge of insurance products. Our executive team has worked in the property casualty                                          insurance industry in excess of a combined 115 years and has extensive experience in                                          developing primary insurance as well as reinsurance products. We structure our reinsurance                                          program with the expectation that a large event, such as a hurricane, will occur in any                                          given year, allowing us to limit our losses when a catastrophic event does occur.      ●Our                                          local market expertise. Our executive experience has been with coastal states, and                                          that is where we intend to continue to focus. These states have some of the highest overall                                          insurance premium rates in the Unites States and have traditionally been underserved                                          by insurance underwriters resulting in the formation of state-run insurers such as LA                                          Citizens, FL Citizens, and TWIA.      ●Our                                          ability to attract independent agencies. Our executive team has long-standing relationships                                          with independent agencies, particularly in Louisiana and Florida. We have experienced                                          multiple catastrophe events with some of our agents, who we believe continue to place                                          business with us as a result of these experiences.      ●Our                                          claims handling expertise. We have experienced some major weather events, including                                          Hurricane Harvey in August, 2017 as well as a major flooding event in Louisiana in August,                                          2016 and believe that we have proven to both our policyholders and agents that we are                                          able to settle claims in a prompt manner. Our President and CEO, Mr. Doug Raucy, is the                                          founder and former head of Allstate’s National Catastrophe Team, and has over 37                                          years of total insurance industry experience. We are committed to helping our policyholders                                          when they need us and we believe those to be the times where we can differentiate ourselves                                          from our competitors.      ●Our                                          strategy to assume policies from the Florida, Louisiana, and Texas residual markets.                                          Depopulating policies from state-run insurers such as FL Citizens, LA Citizens and                                          TWIA gives us the ability to grow to scale quickly and also choose those specific policies,                                          which we believe best enhance our policy portfolio. In addition to favorable economics                                          resulting from depopulation, these policies, by definition have been overlooked by the                                          voluntary market and, in certain instances, can generate attractive returns relative                                          to the risks associated with them.           Our Strategies     Our primary goal is to continue to expand our property and casualty writings through:      ●Increasing                                          our number of voluntary policies. We believe that ease of use enhancements for our                                          web-based agent quoting portal as well as refining our product offerings has positioned                                          us to continue to experience organic new policy growth. Our goal is to continue to grow                                          through strategic relationships with agencies in the states where we currently provide                                          insurance and also potentially in new coastal markets in the United States. Our years                                          of experience in the coastal markets make us qualified to manage agent expectations and                                          provide superior support and service for policyholders.      ●Increasing                                          our wind/hail-only book of business through the depopulation of policies from                                          FL Citizens. We participated in the depopulation of wind/hail-only policies from                                          FL Citizens, which will allow us to quickly establish a significant presence in the State                                          of Florida, where, as of September 30, 2017, we had not yet written any insurance policies.                                          We plan to focus on wind/hail-only and other specialty products in this state where we                                          have extensive management experience.      ●Strategic                                          acquisitions. We intend to explore growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions                                          in coastal states, including Louisiana, Texas and Florida. We also plan to pursue complementary                                          books of business provided they meet our underwriting criteria. We will evaluate each                                          opportunity based on expected economic contribution to our results and support of our                                          market expansion initiatives.      ●Attracting                                          and retaining high-quality agents. We intend to focus our marketing efforts on maintaining                                          and improving our relationships with highly productive independent agents, as well as                                          on attracting new high quality agents in areas with a substantial potential for profitable                                          growth.      ●Reducing                                          our ratio of expenses to net premiums earned and using technology to increase our operating                                          efficiency. We are committed to improving our profitability by reducing expenses                                          through enhanced technologies and by increasing the number of policies that we write                                          through the strategic deployment of our capital. We currently outsource our policy administration                                          and a portion of our claims handling functions to third parties with dedicated Maison                                          oversight and direction, which we believe results in increased service and lower expense                                          and loss ratios.                 4                     Risks Associated With Our Business     In evaluating our business, the following items should be taken into consideration:        ●We                                          have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects.                                          Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently                                          encountered by companies in their early stages of development.      ●We                                          may not have future opportunities to participate in take-out programs or obtain the quantity                                          or quality of policies currently obtained due to changes in the take-out programs, our                                          failure to meet take-out program participation requirements, or due to changes to the                                          market in general.      ●In                                          the property and casualty insurance industry, we compete with large, well-established                                          insurance companies, as well as other specialty insurers. Most of these competitors possess                                          greater financial resources, larger agency networks and greater name recognition than                                          we do.      ●We                                          write insurance policies that cover homeowners, manufactured homes and dwelling fire                                          for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes. We are, therefore, subject                                          to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business,                                          results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various                                          events, including hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, fires                                          and man-made events.      ●The                                                                                                                                                       insurance industry is highly regulated and supervised.

If we are not able to grow in Florida or significantly expand                                          to other states, we may risk higher reinsurance costs and greater loss experience with                                          storm activity occurring in Louisiana and Texas.      ●A                                          substantial portion (approximately 34% as of December 31, 2017) of our in-force policies                                          were assumed from state-run insurers, LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA, and most of                                          these assumed policies cover losses arising only from wind and hail, which creates a                                          large concentration of our business in wind and hail only coverage and limits our ability                                          to implement our restrictive underwriting guidelines.       For a detailed discussion on risk factors associated with our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Company” in this prospectus.     Recent Developments     Repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock     On January 2, 2018, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with 1347 Advisors and IWS Acquisition Corporation, both affiliates of KFSI, pursuant to which we repurchased 60,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company from 1347 Advisors for an aggregate purchase price of $1,740,000, representing (i) $1,500,000, comprised of $25 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, and (ii) declared and unpaid dividends in respect of the dividend payment due on February 23, 2018 amounting to $240,000 in the aggregate. We also agreed to repurchase pursuant to the stock purchase agreement an additional 60,000 shares from IWS Acquisition Corporation, upon completion of this offering, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000, comprised of $25 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, without any dividend or interest payment. We intend to use $1.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering to complete the repurchase of the Series B Preferred Shares from IWS Acquisition Corporation. The foregoing transactions were approved by a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company consisting solely of independent directors.     In connection with the stock purchase agreement, the Performance Shares Grant Agreement, dated February 24, 2015, between the Company and 1347 Advisors, which provided for the issuance of an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock of the Company to 1347 Advisors upon the Company’s achievement of certain performance milestones, was terminated. In connection with the termination, the Company agreed to pay an aggregate cash payment of $300,000 to 1347 Advisors. No common shares were issued to 1347 Advisors under the agreement.     Impact of Hurricane Harvey     In late August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and Louisiana. Maison has many policyholders who have been impacted by this hurricane. This event primarily impacted our Texas policyholders along with a relatively smaller number of Louisiana policyholders. Since our Texas products do not cover the peril of flood, we expect our losses to arise primarily from South Texas where strong winds made landfall. Based on our early analysis, we expect the gross losses to be $23 million which is within the $200 million per occurrence limit of our catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program. Therefore, the pre-tax losses arising from Hurricane Harvey incurred by the Company, net of reinsurance, are not expected to exceed our retention of $5 million.                 5                     Corporate Information      Our business began in February 2012 as part of KFSI when we began conducting market due diligence, establishing the infrastructure and seeking to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to be able to assume and write homeowners’ insurance policies focusing on wind and hail only coverage for the coastal areas in the gulf states of the United States. On October 2, 2012, KFSI formed our company under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary, and contributed this business to us. Our initial public offering was completed on March 31, 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 1511 N. Westshore Blvd., Suite 870, Tampa, Florida 33607.

We may from time     to time elect to issue additional shares of Preferred Stock, and all the additional shares would be deemed to form a single     series with the Preferred Stock.                 6                                          Dividends           Holders         of     the Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate of      % per     annum of the $       per share         liquidation preference (equivalent to $       per annum per     share).                               Dividends         on the Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee         thereof, will be payable quarterly on or about the 15th day of March, June, September and December of each year (each,         a “dividend payment date”), provided that if any dividend payment date is not a business day, then the dividend         that would otherwise have been payable on that dividend payment date may be paid on the next succeeding business day without         adjustment in the amount of the dividend. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear in our stock record         books for the Preferred Stock at the close of business on the corresponding record date, which shall be the first day         of March, June, September and December of each year, whether or not a business day, immediately preceding the applicable         dividend payment date (each, a “dividend record date”). Dividends will be computed on the basis of a 360-day         year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The first dividend record date will be           , 201 . Dividends on the Preferred Stock         will accumulate whether or not the Company has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment         of those dividends and whether or not those dividends are declared by the Board of Directors of the Company.                   When         dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Preferred Stock         and any parity stock, all dividends declared upon the Preferred Stock and such parity stock shall be declared on a pro         rata basis. See “Description of the Preferred Stock — Dividends” in this prospectus.

Holders of the Preferred Stock will     have no right to have the Preferred Stock redeemed. Accordingly, the shares of Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely,     unless and until we decide to redeem them.

Use of Proceeds           We         estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the Preferred Stock issued in this offering will be approximately         $      million after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated offering expenses.  \\\\t          We intend to use $1.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering         to complete the repurchase of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock from IWS Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate         of KFSI, upon completion of this offering. Following the repurchase of the shares, we expect to use the remainder of         the net proceeds from this offering to support our organic growth, and for general corporate purposes, including spending         for business development, sales and marketing and working capital, and for future potential acquisition opportunities.

Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although the Company intends to focus on operating businesses in Asia.      This is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit that we are offering has a price of $10.00 and consists of one ordinary share, one redeemable warrant, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination, as described in more detail in this prospectus. Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per full share, and every ten rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share at the closing of an initial business combination. We will not issue fractional shares. As a result, (i) you must exercise warrants in multiples of two, at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus, to validly exercise your warrants, and (ii) you must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of your rights upon closing of a business combination. Each warrant will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial business combination and 12 months from the date of this prospectus, and will expire five years after the completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption. The exercise price of the warrants is $11.50 per full share.      We have granted Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters, a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 units (over and above the 5,000,000 units referred to above) solely to cover over-allotments, if any.     8i Holdings Limited (an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands), our sponsor, has committed that it and its designees will purchase from us an aggregate of 221,250 units, or “private units,” at $10.00 per private unit (for a total purchase price of $2,212,500). These purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below. They have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 18,750 private units) pro rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option.      There is presently no public market for our units, ordinary shares, warrants or rights. We have applied to have our units listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol “JFKKU” on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on Nasdaq. The ordinary shares, warrants and rights comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 90th day after the date of this prospectus unless Chardan Capital Markets, LLC determines that an earlier date is acceptable, subject to our filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, containing an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering and issuing a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the ordinary shares, warrants and rights will be traded on Nasdaq under the symbols “JFK,” “JFKKW,” and “JFKKR,” respectively. We cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq after this offering.      We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements.

If the business combination is not consummated, such                                          deferred underwriting discounts and commissions will be forfeited by the underwriters.                                          The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting                                          discounts and commissions.        Upon consummation of the offering, $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering (whether or not the over-allotment option has been exercised in full or part) will be deposited into a United States-based account at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Wilmington Trust Company acting as trustee.

You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with different information. We are not making an offer of these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer is not permitted.           2                 General     We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on November 24, 2017 as a business company with limited liability (meaning that our shareholders have no liability, as shareholders of our company, for our liabilities). The liability of a shareholder to a BVI business company, as shareholder, is limited to (a) any amount unpaid on a share held by the shareholder; (b) any liability expressly provided for in the memorandum or articles of association of the company; and (c) any liability to repay a distribution under section 58(1) of the BVI BC Act. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus on targets located in Asia. We do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf), directly or indirectly, contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a transaction. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business.     Background  We believe our management team’s backgrounds provide us with the ability to source transactions and identify target businesses that can thrive as publicly-traded companies. Additionally, over the course of their respective careers, members of our management team have developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will provide us with an important source of initial business combination opportunities.        Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. James Tan, has more than 20 years of experience in building up start-ups, managing publicly listed companies, and executing M&A deals in Asia. Through his privately held vehicle, 8i Capital Limited, Mr. James Tan has identified and acquired private and public companies, developing a large base of relationships and a network in Asia that can deliver opportunities for us, with access to governments, private and public companies with growth prospects, and financial institutions. Mr. Tan, having served as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and director of several public and private companies, both in Asia and the US, has experience with corporate governance and has developed a network of capable people who can assist in completing a business combination.         Our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. William Yap, CFA, has more than 20 years of experience in sourcing and evaluating potential investment targets in Asia, and has developed a proprietary network of business leaders, investors and intermediaries in Asia that can generate deal flows for us. He brings with him a disciplined process of conducting deal origination and evaluation, due diligence, and investment.         We will seek to acquire companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $500 million that are preferably already cash-generative.        Our Competitive Advantages     Status as a Publicly Listed Company     We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.     Strong Financial Position and Flexibility     With the funds held in our trust account, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from this offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing.            3                 Competitive Weaknesses  We believe our competitive weaknesses to be the following:  Limited Financial Resources  Our financial reserves will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. In addition, our financial resources could be reduced because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public shareholders as well as any tender offer we conduct (subject to our being required to maintain net tangible assets in the trust account of no less than $5,000,0001). In the event that we did not have enough funds available to us to complete a business combination, we might be required to seek additional financing in order to complete a business combination.  Lack of experience with blank check companies   Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our management’s lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses.   Limited technical and human resources  As a blank check company, we have limited technical and human resources. Many venture capital funds, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses possess greater technical and human resources than we do and thus we may be at a disadvantage when competing with them for target businesses.   Delay associated with shareholder approval or tender offer    We may be required to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination. If we are not required to obtain shareholder approval of an initial business combination, we will allow our shareholders to sell their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer. Both seeking shareholder approval and conducting a tender offer will delay the consummation of our initial business combination. Other companies competing with us for acquisition opportunities may not be subject to similar requirement, or may be able to satisfy such requirements more quickly than we can. As a result, we may be at a disadvantage in competing for these opportunities.    Inability to find suitable target companies  We may not be able to find a target that meets our selection investment criteria. Even though we have broad discretion to acquire a company that falls outside of our selection criteria, such a target may be less desirable than one that falls within our selection criteria.  Acquisition Strategy     Our acquisition strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, to build a public company. Our selection process will leverage our team’s network of industry, private equity and lending community relationships as well as relationship with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We intend to deploy a pro-active, thematic sourcing strategy and to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our relationships, capital and capital markets expertise and operating experience of James Tan, can help accelerate the target business’ growth and performance.           4                 Investment Criteria     The focus of our management team is to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:      ●Growth                                          Potential     As a result of the Asia region’s strong growth over the past several decades, the region has become home to a large number of small domestic and regional companies, which are serving the ever-increasing needs of economies locally. While such companies have performed relatively well, the vast majority of these companies suffer from a lack of insightful strategy, insufficient capital, operational inefficiencies and various succession issues (as many companies are first-generation and family-owned). This has also resulted in high degree of market fragmentation, without any established regional market leaders. We will seek target businesses for which we can provide strategic advice, access to sufficient capital and effective operational expertise, to grow the business.      ●Long-term                                          Revenue Visibility with Defensible Market Position     We intend to seek target companies that are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where an acquisition may help facilitate growth.      ●Benefits                                          from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities)     We intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience. We expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (ii) the ability to achieve cost savings, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business’ earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.      ●Potential                                          Benefit from Globalization Trends and Possession of Competitive Advantages     Target companies exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our company specific analysis and due diligence review. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and industry background and trends. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue.     These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.     We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we will have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.           5                  We will have until 12 months from the consummation of this offering to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Wilmington Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $500,000, or $575,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per share in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the relevant insider’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem or purchase 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.        If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within this time period, we will liquidate the trust account and distribute the proceeds held therein to our public shareholders and dissolve. If we are forced to liquidate, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation.     Pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination, although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Our board of directors will have broad discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of any prospective target business. The target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of 80% of the trust account balance.           6                 We are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80% of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own. We are also not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party indicating that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view unless the target is affiliated with our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates.     We currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.     Management Operating and Investing Experience     We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.     As more fully discussed in “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.     Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information     We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.           7                 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.     We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.     We are currently a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 405, but are voluntarily choosing to register and report using domestic forms. We are required to determine our status as a foreign private issuer for the 2018 fiscal year as of the last day of our second quarter, or June 30. On such date, if we no longer qualify as a “foreign private issuer” (as set forth in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act), we will then become subject to the U.S. domestic issuer rules as of the first day of our 2019 fiscal year, or January 1, 2019.     Private Placements        In November 2017, April 2018 and July 2018, we sold an aggregate of 1,437,500 ordinary shares to certain of our initial shareholders, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as the “insider shares,” for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.017 per share. The insider shares held by our initial shareholders include an aggregate of up to 187,500 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part, so that our initial shareholders will collectively own 20.0% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares after this offering (excluding the sale of the private units and assuming our initial shareholders do not purchase units in this offering). None of our initial shareholders has indicated any intention to purchase units in this offering.      The insider shares are identical to the ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering. However, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, (A) to vote their insider shares (as well as any public shares acquired in or after this offering) in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would stop our public shareholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or 18 months, as applicable) unless we provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares into the right to receive cash from the trust account in connection with any such vote, (C) not to convert any insider shares (as well as any other shares acquired in or after this offering) into the right to receive cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination (or sell any shares they hold to us in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination) or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (D) that the insider shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the insider shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until (1) with respect to 50% of the insider shares, the earlier of six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination and the date on which the closing price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our initial business combination and (2) with respect to the remaining 50% of the insider shares, six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Up to 187,500 of the insider shares may also be released from escrow earlier than this date for forfeiture and cancellation if the over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part.           8                    In addition, 8i Holdings Limited (an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands), our sponsor, has committed that it and its designees will purchase from us an aggregate of 221,250 private units at $10.00 per private unit (for a total purchase price of $2,212,500). These purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below. They have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 18,750 private units) pro rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The proceeds from the private placement of the private units will be added to the proceeds of this offering and placed in an account in the United States maintained by Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee.          The private units are identical to the units sold in this offering except that the private warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. Additionally, because the private units will be issued in a private transaction, our sponsor and its permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the private warrants for cash even if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered ordinary shares. Furthermore, our sponsor and its designees have agreed (A) to vote the ordinary shares underlying the private units, or “private shares,” in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would stop our public shareholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or 18 months, as applicable) unless we provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote, (C) not to convert any private shares for cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (D) that the private shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. Our sponsor and its designees have also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private units or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the insider shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the insider shares must agree to, each as described above) until the completion of our initial business combination.     If public units or shares are purchased by any of our directors, officers or initial shareholders, they will be entitled to funds from the trust account to the same extent as any public shareholder upon our liquidation but will not have redemption rights related thereto.     Corporate Information     Our principal executive offices are located at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street, #08-13 The Central, Singapore 059817, and our telephone number is +65 67880388.           9                 The Offering     In making your decision on whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the backgrounds of the members of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company and the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section below entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 of this prospectus.            Securities offered               5,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, each unit consisting                                          of one ordinary share, one redeemable warrant, and one right. Each redeemable warrant                                          entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one ordinary share at a price                                          of $11.50 per full share. Because                                          the warrants may only be exercised for whole numbers of shares, only an even number of                                          warrants may be exercised at any given time. Every ten rights entitle the holder to receive                                          one ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination                                    Listing of our securities and proposed     symbols               We anticipate the units, and the ordinary shares, warrants and rights,                                     once they begin separate trading, will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “JFKKU,”                                     “JFK,” “JFKKW,” and “JFKKR,” respectively.                                                    Each of the ordinary     shares, warrants and rights may trade separately on the 90th day after the date of this prospectus unless Chardan     Capital Markets, LLC determines that an earlier date is acceptable (based upon, among other things, its assessment of the     relative strengths of the securities markets and small capitalization and blank check companies in general, and the trading     pattern of, and demand for, our securities in particular). In no event will Chardan Capital Markets, LLC allow separate trading     of the ordinary shares, warrants and rights until we file an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds     of this offering.                                                 Once the ordinary     shares, warrants and rights commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate     their units into the component pieces. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate     the units into separately trading ordinary shares, warrants and rights. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation     of the units and only whole warrants will trade.                                                 We will file     a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC, including an audited balance sheet, promptly upon the consummation of this offering,     which is anticipated to take place three business days from the date the units commence trading. The audited balance sheet     will reflect our receipt of the proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment option if the over-allotment option is exercised     on the date of this prospectus. If the over-allotment option is exercised after the date of this prospectus, we will file     an amendment to the Form 8-K or a new Form 8-K to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the over-allotment     option. We will also include in the Form 8-K, or amendment thereto, or in a subsequent Form 8-K, information indicating if     Chardan Capital Markets, LLC has allowed separate trading of the ordinary shares, warrants and rights prior to the 90th     day after the date of this prospectus.            10                       Ordinary shares:                                     Number issued and outstanding before this     offering and the private placement           1,437,500 shares(1)                         Number to be issued and outstanding after     this offering and sale of private units           6,471,250 shares(2)      (1)This number includes an aggregate                                          of up to 187,500 ordinary shares held by our initial shareholders that are subject to                                          forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters in full.      (2)Assumes the over-allotment option                                          has not been exercised and an aggregate of 187,500 ordinary shares held by our initial                                          shareholders have been forfeited. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full,                                          there will be a total of 7,427,500 ordinary shares issued and outstanding.           Redeemable Warrants:                                     Number issued and outstanding before this     offering and the private placement           0 warrants                         Number to be issued and outstanding after     this offering and sale of private units           5,221,250 warrants(3)                          Exercisability               Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half                                     (1/2) of one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment as                                     described in this prospectus. Pursuant                                     to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number                                     of shares. This means that only an even number of warrants may be exercised at any given time                                     by a warrant holder.          (3)Assumes the over-allotment option                                          has not been exercised. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, there will                                          be a total of 5,990,000 warrants, including an aggregate of 240,000 private warrants.            Exercise price               $11.50 per full share. No public warrants will be exercisable                                          for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the                                          ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating                                          to such ordinary shares. It is our current intention to have an effective and current                                          registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants                                          and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares in effect promptly following                                          consummation of an initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a                                          registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public                                          warrants is not effective within 90 days following the consummation of our initial business                                          combination, public warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration                                          statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration                                          statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from                                          registration under the Securities Act. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise                                          price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient                                          obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the                                          warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and                                          the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The                                          “fair market value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the                                          ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the day prior to the date of exercise.                                          For example, if a holder held 150 warrants to purchase 75 shares and the fair market                                          value on the date prior to exercise was $17.25, that holder would receive 25 shares without                                          the payment of any additional cash consideration. If an exemption from registration is                                          not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.               11                       Exercise     period           The                                          warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial business                                          combination and 12 months from the date of this prospectus. The warrants will expire                                          at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial                                          business combination, or earlier upon redemption.                             Redemption               We may redeem the outstanding warrants (excluding the private warrants                                     but including any outstanding warrants issued upon exercise of the unit purchase option issued                                     to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant:                                         ●           at any time while the warrants are exercisable,                                     ●      upon     a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption,                                     ●     if,     and only if, the last sales price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $16.50 per share for any 20 trading days within     a 30 trading day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption, and                                     ●     if,     and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants     at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until     the date of redemption.                                      If the foregoing     conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption, each warrant holder can exercise his, her or its warrant prior     to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the ordinary shares may fall below the $16.50 trigger price as well     as the $11.50 warrant exercise price per full share after the redemption notice is issued and not limit our ability to complete     the redemption.                                      The redemption criteria     for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the     initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise     price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price     to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.                                     If we call the warrants     for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants     to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole     warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary     shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair     market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” shall mean the average     reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date     on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Whether we will exercise our option to require all holders     to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis” will depend on a variety of factors including the price of our     ordinary shares at the time the warrants are called for redemption, our cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive     share issuances.           12                       Rights:                  Number issued and outstanding before this     offering and the private placement            0 rights                         Number to be issued and outstanding after     this offering and sale of private units            5,221,250 rights(4)                         Terms of Rights            Except in cases     where we are not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-tenth     (1/10) of an ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination. In the event we will not be the surviving     company upon completion of our initial business combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert     his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of a share underlying each right upon consummation of the     business combination. We will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will     either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of British     Virgin Islands law. As a result, you must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of your rights     upon closing of a business combination. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time     period and we redeem the public shares for the funds held in the trust account, holders of rights will not receive any of     such funds for their rights and the rights will expire worthless.                          Offering proceeds to be held in trust               $47,787,500 of the net proceeds of this offering (or $55,100,000 if                                     the over-allotment option is exercised in full), plus $2,212,500 we will receive from the                                     sale of the private units (or $2,400,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full),                                     for an aggregate of $50,000,000 (or an aggregate of $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option                                     is exercised in full), or $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering (regardless                                     of whether or not the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part) will be placed in                                     a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank in the United States, maintained by Wilmington Trust                                     Company, acting as trustee pursuant to an agreement to be signed on the date of this prospectus.                                     Such amount includes $1,500,000, or up to $0.30 per unit (or $1,725,000 if the underwriters’                                     over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable to the underwriters as deferred underwriting                                     discounts and commissions. Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will                                     govern the investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct                                     JPMorgan Chase Bank to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions and to custody                                     the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed in accordance with the investment                                     management trust agreement. The remaining $500,000 of net proceeds of this offering will not                                     be held in the trust account.                                         Except as set forth     below, the proceeds in the trust account will not be released until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination     within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if we have not completed a business combination in the required     time period. Therefore, unless and until an initial business combination is consummated, the proceeds held in the trust account     will not be available for our use for any expenses related to this offering or expenses which we may incur related to the     investigation and selection of a target business and the negotiation of an agreement to acquire a target business.      (4)Assumes the over-allotment option                                          has not been exercised. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, there will                                          be a total of 5,990,000 rights, including an aggregate of 240,000 private rights.           13                                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be released to                                          us from the trust account any interest earned on the funds in the trust account that                                          we need to pay our income or other tax obligations. With these exceptions, expenses incurred                                          by us may be paid prior to a business combination only from the net proceeds of this                                          offering not held in the trust account (estimated to initially be $500,000); provided,                                          however, that in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of                                          this offering if the funds not held in the trust account are insufficient, our initial                                          shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to,                                          loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable                                          in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes                                          would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,                                          or, at the relevant insider’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted                                          upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of $10.00                                          per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued units to acquire                                          55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of                                          rights) and warrants to purchase 25,000 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so                                          converted). If we do not complete a business combination, the loans would be repaid out                                          of funds not held in the trust account, and only to the extent available.                             Limited payments     to insiders           Prior to the consummation     of a business combination, there will be no fees, reimbursements or other cash payments paid to our initial shareholders,     officers, directors or their affiliates prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation     of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than:                                     ●     repayment     at the closing of this offering of loans which may be made by our insiders, officers, directors or any of its or their affiliates     to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the terms of which have not been determined;     and                                     ●      reimbursement     of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating     possible business targets and business combinations.                                     There is no limit     on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the     available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and the interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account     available to us, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Our audit     committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to any initial shareholder or member of our management     team, or their respective affiliates, and any reimbursements and payments made to members of our audit committee will be reviewed     and approved by our Board of Directors, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.           14                       Shareholder approval of,     or tender offer in connection with, initial business combination           In connection     with any proposed initial business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of such initial business combination     at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether     they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit     in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public     shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro     rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the     limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter     agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on     deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each     public shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or     its shares. If enough shareholders tender their shares so that we are unable to satisfy any applicable closing condition set     forth in the definitive agreement related to our initial business combination, or we are unable to maintain net tangible assets     of at least $5,000,001, we will not consummate such initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek     shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender     offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, whether the terms of the transaction     would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would     require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). If we so choose and we are     legally permitted to do so, we will have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their     shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, which     regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially     the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy     rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon     such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted     are voted in favor of the business combination.                                     We have determined     not to consummate any business combination unless we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation     in order to avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. The $5,000,001 net tangible asset value     would be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and liabilities of the combined     company.                                     However, if we seek     to consummate a business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or     requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such business combination,     the net tangible asset requirement may limit our ability to consummate such a business combination and may force us to seek     third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate     such business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at     all.           15                                   Our     initial shareholders, including our sponsor, have agreed (i) to vote their insider shares, private shares and any public shares     purchased in or after this offering in favor of any proposed business combination and (ii) not to convert any shares (including     the insider shares) in connection with a shareholder vote to approve, or sell their shares to us in any tender offer in connection     with, a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction we     would not need any public shareholders to vote in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming     that only a quorum is present, the over-allotment option is not exercised and the initial shareholders do not purchase any     units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market). None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their     affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units in this offering or any units or ordinary shares in the open market     or in private transactions (other than the private units). However, if a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate     an intention to vote, against a proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates     could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. There is no limit     on the amount of shares that may be purchased by the insiders. Any purchases would be made in compliance with federal securities     laws, including the fact that all material information will be made public prior to such purchase, and no purchases would     be made if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop     potential manipulation of a company’s stock.                         Conversion rights           In connection with     a business combination, public shareholders will have the right to convert their shares into an amount equal to (1) the number     of public shares being converted by such public holder divided by the total number of public shares multiplied by (2) the     amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share), which includes the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,     plus a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account less any amounts necessary to pay our     taxes. At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may elect to convert their share     regardless of whether or not they vote to approve the business combination.                                     Whether we elect     to effectuate our initial business combination via shareholder vote or tender offer, we may require public shareholders     wishing to exercise conversion rights, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,”     to either tender the certificates they are seeking to convert to our transfer agent or to deliver the shares they are seeking     to convert to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit / Withdrawal At Custodian)     System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. There is a nominal     cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System.     The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass     this cost on to the converting holder. The foregoing is different from the procedures used by traditional blank check companies.     In order to perfect conversion rights in connection with their business combinations, many traditional blank check companies     would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply     vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise     its conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange     for it to deliver its certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window”     after the consummation of the business combination during which it could monitor the price of the company’s stock in     the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, it could sell its shares in the open market before actually delivering     his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed     to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become an “option” right surviving past the consummation of the     business combination until the converting holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery     prior to the closing of the shareholder meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert is irrevocable once the     business combination is completed.           16                                   Pursuant     to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to give a minimum of only ten days’     notice for each general meeting. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares     into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery     requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly,     investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise     would not want to.                                      If we require public     shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares to comply with specific delivery requirements for conversion described     above and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering     public shareholders.                                     Please see the risk     factors titled “In connection with any shareholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination,     we may require shareholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply     with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior     to the deadline for exercising their rights” and “If we require public shareholders who wish to convert their     ordinary shares to comply with the delivery requirements for conversion, such converting shareholders may be unable to sell     their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.”                                     Once the shares     are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under British Virgin Islands law, the transfer agent will then     update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions.                          Automatic liquidation if no business combination               As described above, if we fail to consummate a business combination                                     within 12 months from the consummation of this offering, it will trigger our automatic winding                                     up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum                                     and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone                                     through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the BVI BC Act. Accordingly, no vote would                                     be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and                                     liquidation. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business                                     combination within 12 months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time                                     to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for                                     a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our                                     amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be                                     entered into between us and Wilmington Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order                                     to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders                                     or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable                                     deadline, must deposit into the trust account $500,000, or $575,000 if the underwriters’                                     over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per share in either case), on or prior to                                     the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured                                     promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event                                     that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside                                     the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial                                     business combination, or, at the relevant insider’s discretion, converted upon consummation                                     of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our                                     shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes,                                     to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of                                     our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five                                     days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to                                     issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable                                     deadline.               17                                   If we     are forced to liquidate, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account     calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest).                                     Prior to such distribution,     we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are     actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to     amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought     against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions     received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to     have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engage to assist us in any way in connection     with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,     interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they     will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they     will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.                                     The holders of the     insider shares and private units will not participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such securities.                                     James Tan, our Chief     Executive Officer, has contractually agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that, if we liquidate the trust account     prior to the consummation of a business combination, he will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are     not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services     rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. Accordingly, if a claim brought by a target business or vendor did not     exceed the amount of funds available to us outside of the trust account, James Tan would not have any obligation to indemnify     such claims as they would be paid from such available funds. However, if a claim exceeded such amounts, the only exception     to James Tan’s obligations to pay such claim would be if the party executed an agreement waiving any right, title, interest     or claim of any kind they have in or to any monies held in the trust account. We cannot assure you that James Tan will be     able to satisfy these obligations if he is required to do so. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the per-share distribution     from the trust account, if we liquidate the trust account because we have not completed a business combination within the     required time period, and assuming that we do not extend out life beyond 12 months prior to a business combination, will not     be less than $10.00.                                     We will pay the     costs of liquidating the trust account from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient,     James Tan, our Chief Executive Officer, has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation     (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $18,500) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such     expenses.                       The     underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust account     in the event we do not consummate a business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or 18 months,     as applicable) and in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available     to fund the redemption of our public shares.             18                 RISKS     We are a blank check company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision on whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company, as well as the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act and, therefore, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings differ from this offering, please see “Proposed Business — Comparison to offerings of blank check companies subject to Rule 419.” You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 of this prospectus.     SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA     The following table summarizes the relevant financial data for our business and should be read with our financial statements, which are included in this prospectus. We have not had any significant operations to date, so only balance sheet data are presented.

(2)Excludes                                          prepaid expenses and deferred offering costs.        (3)  The                                          “as adjusted” total liabilities represents up to $1,500,000 of deferred underwriting                                          discounts and commissions that would be payable in the event that the maximum number                                          of shareholders redeemed their shares. The actual liabilities of $241,391 represents                                          $240,626 of a related party loan from 8i Enterprises Pte Ltd, which will be repaid using                                          the proceeds received from the offering on the date the offering is consummated. The                                          $1,500,000 of deferred underwriting discounts is not due until an initial business combination                                          is consummated, for which we have until 12 months from the closing of this offering to                                          consummate (or 18 months if our time to complete a business combination is extended as                                          described herein).       The “as adjusted” information gives effect to the sale of the units we are offering, including the application of the related gross proceeds and the payment of the estimated remaining costs from such sale and the repayment of the accrued and other liabilities required to be repaid.        The “as adjusted” working capital amount includes the $50,000,000 to be held in the trust account, less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of up to $1,500,000 that would be payable in the event that the maximum number of shareholders redeemed their shares, which, except for limited situations described in this prospectus, will be available to us only upon the consummation of our initial business combination within the time period described in this prospectus. The “as adjusted” total assets amount includes the $50,000,000 to be held in the trust account, including the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $1,500,000. If our initial business combination is not consummated, the trust account, less amounts we are permitted to withdraw as described in this prospectus, will be distributed solely to our public shareholders (subject to our obligations under British Virgin Islands law to provide for claims of creditors). The actual deferred offering costs of $52,739 will be reclassified as a charge to additional paid-in capital from the gross proceeds in connection with the consummation of the offering. Any additional offering costs will also be charged to additional paid-in capital.      We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.           19                 '},\n",

OVERALL STRATEGIC DIRECTION     The Company is in the Photo Voltaic (PV) solar systems industry,  and is an electrical product and services supplier.  The Company plans to build out a network of operations in major cities in the USA in order to establish a national base of PV suppliers, lighting suppliers and electrical service operations centers.  This combination of services, solar, lighting, HVAC and electric, provides the company with a solid base in the electrical services business and a solid base in the growth markets of solar industry.     OVERVIEW     As of April 22, 2019, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year as funding becomes available. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. We remain committed to high quality operations.     DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS     ABCO sells and installs Solar Photovoltaic electric systems that allow the customer to produce their own power on their residence or business property.  These products, installed by our crews, are purchased from both USA and offshore manufacturers. We have available and utilize many suppliers of US manufactured solar products from such companies as Global Solar, Mia Soleil, Canadian Solar and various Korean, German and Chinese suppliers.  In addition, we purchase from a number of local and regional distributors whose products are readily available and selected for markets and price.  ABCO offers solar leasing and long-term financing programs from Alternative Energy Finance Corporation, Service Finance Company, Green Sky, Sunrun and others that are offered to ABCO customers and other marketing and installation organizations.     ABCO also sells and installs energy efficient lighting products and solar powered street lights, HVAC equipment including solar powered HVAC and lighting accessories. ABCO contracts directly with manufacturers to purchase its products which are sold to residential and commercial customers.     ABCO has Arizona statewide approval as a registered electrical services and solar products installer and is an air conditioner and refrigeration installer. Our Solar Electric license is ROC 258378 and our HVAC license is ROC 323162 and we are fully licensed to offer commercial and residential throughout Arizona. As in all states, we will comply with all licensing requirements of those jurisdictions.     The ABCO subsidiary, Alternative Energy Finance Corporation (AEFC) a Wyoming Company provides funding for leases of photovoltaic systems. AEFC financed its owned leases from its own cash and now arranges financing with funds provided by investors and other lessors.      1   Table of Contents         COMPETITION     The solar power market itself is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving.  Price and available financing are the principal methods of competition in the industry.  Based upon these two criteria, our position in the industry is relatively small.  There is no competitive data available to us in our competitive position within the industry.  Our competitors have established market positions more prominent than ours, and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish a successful distribution network, we may be unable to achieve sales and market share.  There are a number of major multi-national corporations that produce solar power products such as Hanergy, Sunpower, First Solar, GE, Mitsubishi, Solar World AG and Sanyo.  Also established integrators are growing and consolidating, including GoSolar, Sunenergy and Real Good Solar and we expect that future competition will include new entrants to the solar power market.  Further, many of our competitors are developing and are currently producing products based on new solar power technologies that may have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs.     COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES     The Company believes that its key competitive advantages are: (1)  The ability to make decisions and use management’s many years of business experience to make the right decision; (2) Experience with regional  expansion programs by management; (3) Experience with management of employee operated facilities from a central management office; (4) Experience with multi-media promotional program for name recognition and product awareness; and (5) Alternative energy is a fast growing and popular industry that relates well to customers and current or future shareholders that recognize the market, products and business focus.     ADVANTAGES OF COMPETITORS OVER US  The Company believes the following are advantages of Competitors over us are (1) Larger competitors have more capital; (2) Experience with National expansion programs by management; (3) Larger companies will get the larger contracts because of the level of experience; (4) We have the same products but must pay more because of volume and this will be a price consideration in bidding competition; and (5) We are a small company that may not be able to compete because we do not have experience or working capital adequate to compete with other companies.     CURRENT BUSINESS FOCUS     We believe that we have developed very good promotional material and advertising products.  We have developed the key messages and promotional pieces that are relevant to our business and inexpensive to produce.   We have built an informative and interactive web site that will allow people to assess their requirements and partially build and price a system, much like the automobile dealers utilize. Additional sales promotion will increase when we have secured outside financing or increased sales through direct sales efforts. Readers should review our website at www.abcosolar.com and www.abcoenergy.com. We have established a direct sales force to sell to Government agencies including State, Local and Federal resources and a separate division to call on the many American Indian governments in the US. This allows us to quote with our specifications, products and services on Requests for Proposals (RFP’s) that are issued by the Government Services Agency (GSA), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and other agencies.  By departmentalizing this opportunity, we get more information on projects than is available in the normal course of business.     ABCO will not manufacture its solar voltanic (PV) products. We will continue to be a sales and installation contractor with plans to enter the markets of major US and international cities. We will sell and use commercial off the shelf components. Initially this will include the solar panels and LED lighting products purchased to our specification. A strong alliance with a well-respected distributor will be the most conservative decision for the Company at this time.     FINANCIAL RESOURCES     ABCO’s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through the sale of equity and capital contribution from shareholders.  We will continue to source capital from the equity and debt markets in order to fund our plans for expansion if we are unable to produce adequate capital from operations.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain adequate capital from these sources, or at all.      2   Table of Contents         RISK FACTORS      RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS     The Company has a ten year operating history upon which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects.  We may not be successful in our efforts to grow our business and to earn increased revenues.  An investment in our securities represents significant risk and you may lose all or part of your entire investment.     Our business must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in our stage of operations, particularly providing services in the well-serviced solar installation service industry. As a result, management may be unable to adjust its spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. This inability could cause losses in a given period to be greater than expected.     Since incorporation, we have expended financial resources on the development of our business. As a result, some losses have been incurred. Management anticipates that losses may increase from current levels because the Company expects to incur additional costs and expenses related to: expansion of operations; marketing and promotional activities for business sales; addition of new personnel; and the development of relationships with strategic business partners.     The Company’s ability to sustain profitable operations depends on its ability to generate and sustain sales while maintaining reasonable expense levels. We cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.     Management expects both quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future. Because our operating results will be volatile and difficult to predict, in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly. The Company’s operating results are not followed by securities analysts at this time and there is no guarantee that the stock will be followed by securities analysts in the future.  A number of factors will cause gross margins to fluctuate in future periods. Factors that may harm our business or cause our operating results to fluctuate include the following: (1) the inability to obtain advertisers at reasonable cost; (2) the ability of competitors to offer new or enhanced services or products; (3) price competition; the failure to develop marketing relationships with key business partners; (4) increases in our marketing and advertising costs; (5)  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of operations; (6) a change to or changes to government regulations; (7) a general economic slowdown. Any change in one or more of these factors could reduce our ability to earn and grow revenue in future periods.     OUR CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS RELY HEAVILY UPON OUR KEY EMPLOYEE, CHARLES O’DOWD.     We have been heavily dependent upon the expertise and management of Mr. Charles O’Dowd, President, and our future performance will depend upon his continued services. The loss of the services of Mr. O’Dowd could seriously interrupt our business operations and could have a very negative impact on our ability to fulfill our business plan and to carry out our existing operations. The Company currently does not maintain key man life insurance on this individual. There can be no assurance that a suitable replacement could be found for him upon retirement, resignation, inability to act on our behalf, or death.         3   Table of Contents         RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY     THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT INITIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES SUCH AS OUR SOLAR POWER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.     The United States and countries worldwide have recently experienced a period of declining economies and turmoil in financial markets. A sustained economic recovery is uncertain. In particular, terrorist acts and similar events, continued unrest in the Middle East or war in general could contribute to a slowdown of the market demand for products that require significant initial capital expenditures, including demand for solar power systems and new residential and commercial buildings. In addition, increases in interest rates may increase financing costs to customers, which in turn may decrease demand for our solar power products. If an economic recovery is slowed as a result of the recent economic, political and social events, or if there are further terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere, we may experience decreases in the demand for our solar power products, which may harm our operating results.     IF THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF COMPONENTS AND/OR KEY COMPONENTS RISE SIGNIFICANTLY IN PRICE THAT MAY CONSTRAIN OUR REVENUE GROWTH.     The market for photovoltaic installations has continued to grow despite world-wide financial and economic issues. The introduction of significant production capacity has continued and has increased supply and reduced the cost of solar panels. If demand increases and supply contracts, the resulting likely price increase could adversely affect sales and profitability. From 2009 through 2014, there was a tremendous increase in the capacity to produce solar modules, primarily from China, which coupled with the worst economic downturn in nearly a century, significantly reduced the price of solar panels.  As demand for solar panels will likely increase with an economic recovery, demand and pricing for solar modules could increase, potentially limiting access to solar modules and reducing our selling margins for panels.     EXISTING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES AND CHANGES TO THESE REGULATIONS AND POLICIES MAY PRESENT TECHNICAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO THE PURCHASE AND USE OF SOLAR POWER PRODUCTS, WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.     The market for electricity generation is heavily influenced by foreign, U.S. federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities.  These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the U.S. these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified.  Customer purchases of or further investment in the research and development of alternative energy sources, including solar power technology, could be deterred by these regulations and policies, which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar power products, for example, without certain major incentive programs and or the regulatory mandated exception for solar power systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility network. These fees could increase the cost to our customers of using our solar power products and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.     We anticipate that our solar power products and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, and environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering and related matters. It is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses to us and our resellers and their customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products.         4   Table of Contents         THE REDUCTION, ELIMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR ON-GRID SOLAR ELECTRICITY APPLICATIONS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR SOLAR PV SYSTEMS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS.     The market for solar energy applications depends in large part on the availability and size of local, state and federal government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market. The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and non-solar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business.     The cost of solar power currently is less than retail electricity rates in most markets, and we believe solar will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, federal, state and local government bodies, the United States has provided incentives in the form of feed-in tariffs, or FITs, rebates, tax credits and other incentives to system owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar PV systems to promote the use of solar electricity in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Many of these government incentives expire, phase out over time, terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding or require renewal by the applicable authority. In addition, electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other non-solar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry. Reductions in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar PV systems, which would adversely affect sales of our products.     OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE.     We do not manufacture our own products. We can and do use a variety of products and do not have a commitment to any single manufacturer.  We do not warranty our products because this is the responsibility of the manufacturer.  However, we do warranty our installation workmanship and could suffer loss of customer referrals and reputation degradation if our quality workmanship is not maintained.     WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS.     The development of our services will require the commitment of resources to increase the advertising, marketing and future expansion of our business. In addition, expenditures will be required to enable us in 2019 and 2020 to conduct planned business research, development of new affiliate and associate offices, and marketing of our existing and future products and services. Currently, we have no established bank-financing arrangements. Therefore, it is possible that we would need to seek additional financing through subsequent future private offering of our equity securities, or through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners.     We cannot give any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.  Sales of existing shareholders of the common stock and preferred stock in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and could impair the Company’s future ability to raise capital through the sale of the equity securities.  The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our compensation.  If adequate, additional financing is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business development plan or continue our business operations.     OUR LIABILITY INSURANCE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE IN A CATASTROPHIC SITUATION.     We currently maintain property damage insurance in the aggregate amount of approximately $500,000. We currently maintain liability insurance of up to $5,000,000 and product liability insurance up to $4,000,000.  Material damage to, or the loss to our facilities or equipment due to fire, severe weather, flood or other catastrophe, even if insured against, could result in a significant loss to the Issuer.         5   Table of Contents         THE SERVICES WE INTEND TO PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS MAY NOT GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WHICH WOULD PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING SALES AND MARKET SHARE.     The market for solar power is emerging and rapidly evolving, and its future success is uncertain. If solar power technology proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for solar power products fails to develop sufficiently, we would be unable to achieve sales and market share. In addition, demand for solar power in the markets and geographic regions we target may not develop or may develop more slowly than we anticipate. Many factors may influence the widespread adoption of solar power technology and demand for solar power, including:       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPerformance and reliability of solar power products as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy products \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tCost-effectiveness of solar power technologies as compared with conventional and competitive alternative energy technologies;  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSuccess of alternative distributed generation technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, wind turbines, bio-diesel generators and large-scale solar thermal technologies; \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the viability of conventional and competitive alternative energy sources; \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tIncreases or decreases in the prices of oil, coal and natural gas; \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tCapital expenditures by customers, who tend to decrease when domestic or foreign economies slow; and \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t●   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tContinued deregulation of the electric power industry and broader energy industry \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t       WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND OTHER ENERGY GENERATION PRODUCTS. IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE AND SALES.     The mainstream power generation market and related product sectors are well established and we are competing with power generation from more traditional process that can generate power at lower costs than most renewable or environmentally driven processes. Further, within the renewable power generation and technologies markets we face competition from other methods of producing renewable or environmentally positive power. Then, the solar power market itself is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. Our competitors have established market positions more prominent than ours, and if we fail to attract and retain customers, we may be unable to achieve sales and market share. There are a number of major multi-national corporations that provide solar installation services such as REC, Solar City and Sunpower Corporation. Established integrators are growing and consolidating, including GoSolar, Sunwize, Sunenergy and Real Good Solar and we expect that future competition will include new entrants to the solar power market.  Further, many of our competitors are developing and are currently providing products based on new solar power technologies that may have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs.     Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and other resources than we do. Our competitors’ greater sizes in some cases provides them with competitive advantages with respect to manufacturing costs and the ability to allocate costs across a greater volume of production and purchase raw materials at lower prices. They also have far greater name recognition, an established distribution network and an installed base of customers. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with current and potential resellers, which have extensive knowledge of our target markets. As a result, our competitors will be able to devote greater resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products and may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements than we can.         6   Table of Contents         WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BECOME A REPORTING COMPANY UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (“1934 ACT”) IN COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS HAS BEEN EXPENSIVE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ABSORB SUCH COSTS.     We have incurred significant costs associated by our becoming a company under the 1934 Act for reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. In addition, we may not be able to absorb these costs of being a public company, which will negatively affect our business operations.     THE LIMITED PUBLIC COMPANY EXPERIENCE OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. SECURITIES LAWS.     We have elected to become a reporting company under the Act of 1934.  Our management team has limited public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, including the establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements, which may be necessary in the future to maintain our public company status.  If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a public company would be in jeopardy.     RISKS RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES AND RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING.     WE MAY NEVER PAY ANY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS.     We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.     The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.     OUR CONTROLLING SECURITY HOLDERS MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT CONFLICT WITH YOUR INTERESTS.     Mr. Charles O’Dowd, President and Wayne Marx, Secretary, own collectively more than 83% of our common and preferred stock voting rights. In this case, these two persons will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, and they will have significant control over our management and policies.       The directors elected by our controlling security holders will be able to significantly influence decisions affecting our capital structure.  This control may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other security holders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.  For example, our controlling security holders will be able to control the sale or other disposition of our operating businesses and subsidiaries to another entity.         7   Table of Contents         OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED PENNY STOCK, WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES.     Our common stock is tradable in the secondary market but we are subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the SEC that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities.     Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the FINRA system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.     THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A PUBLIC MARKET ON A RECOGNIZED EXCHANGE. THEREFORE, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK.     There is a limited established public trading market for our common stock.  On August 30, 2015, we began trading on the OTCQB Market.  For the nine month period prior thereto, we traded on the grey market while FINRA reviewed the application of a market maker to enable our Company to move up in trading status. On May 8,2017, the Company’s common stock was delisted from the OTCQB to the OTC Pink market for failure to meet the closing bid price requirement that the shares close at or above $0.01 for 30 consecutive trading days. The Company re-applied for listing again on the OTCQB and was approved and began to trade on April 8, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Company can continue to meet the $0.01 requirement or that a regular trading market will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment.       WE ARE AN “EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY” AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.     We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions.  If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.     Unless the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards, and until such time as those standards apply to private companies, we have  elected  to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”      8   Table of Contents         RISKS RELATING TO OUR EQUITY LINE WITH OASIS CAPITAL      RESALES OF SHARES PURCHASED BY OASIS CAPITAL UNDER THE EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT MAY CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.      Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we have the right to “put,” or sell, up to $5,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock to Oasis Capital. Unless terminated earlier, Oasis Capital’s purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date on which Oasis Capital shall have purchased shares pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 or December 11, 2020. This arrangement is also sometimes referred to herein as the “Equity Line.” The common stock to be issued to Oasis Capital pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement will be purchased at a price equal to 85% of the “Market Price,” which is defined as the lowest traded price on the OTCQB, as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P., during the five consecutive trading days following the date that Oasis Capital receives the respective Put Shares in its account, which in most circumstances will begin on the trading day immediately following the date that a put notice is delivered to Oasis Capital (a “Put Date”). Oasis Capital will have the financial incentive to sell the shares of our common stock issuable under the Equity Purchase Agreement in advance of or upon receiving such shares and to realize the profit equal to the difference between the discounted price and the current market price of the shares. This may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.      The foregoing description of the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Equity Purchase Agreement itself.      PUTS UNDER EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT MAY CAUSE DILUTION TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.     From time to time during the term of the Equity Purchase Agreement, and at our sole discretion, we may present Oasis Capital with a put notice requiring Oasis Capital to purchase shares of our common stock. As a result, our existing stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any of the shares by Oasis Capital. Oasis Capital may resell some, if not all, of the shares that we issue to it under the Equity Purchase Agreement and such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. To the extent of any such decline, any subsequent puts would require us to issue and sell a greater number of shares to Oasis Capital in exchange for each dollar of the put amount. Under these circumstances, the existing stockholders of our company will experience greater dilution. The effect of this dilution may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to decrease further, both because of the downward pressure on the stock price that would be caused by a large number of sales of our shares into the public market by Oasis Capital, and because our existing stockholders may disagree with a decision to sell shares to Oasis Capital at a time when our stock price is low, and may in response decide to sell additional shares, further decreasing our stock price. If we draw down amounts under the Equity Line when our share price is decreasing, we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount of funding.      THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL SATISFY THE CONDITIONS TO THE EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT.      Although the Equity Purchase Agreement provides that we can require Oasis Capital to purchase, at our discretion, up to $5,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock in the aggregate, our ability to put shares to Oasis Capital and obtain funds when requested is limited by the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, including restrictions on when we may exercise our put rights, restrictions on the amount we may put to Oasis Capital at any one time, which is determined in part by the trading volume of our common stock, and a limitation on our ability to put shares to Oasis Capital to the extent that it would cause Oasis Capital to beneficially own more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.         9   Table of Contents         WE MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH OASIS CAPITAL.      Our ability to draw down funds and sell shares under the Equity Purchase Agreement requires that a registration statement be declared effective and continue to be effective registering the resale of shares issuable under the Equity Purchase Agreement. The registration statement of which this prospectus is a part registers the resale of 250,000,000 shares of our common stock issuable under the Equity Line. Our ability to sell any additional shares under the Equity Purchase Agreement will be contingent on our ability to prepare and file one or more additional registration statements registering the resale of such additional shares. These registration statements (and any post-effective amendments thereto) may be subject to review and comment by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission and will require the consent of our independent registered public accounting firm. Therefore, the timing of effectiveness of these registration statements (and any post-effective amendments thereto) cannot be assured. Even if we are successful in causing one or more registration statements registering the resale of some or all of the shares issuable under the Equity Purchase Agreement to be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a timely manner, we may not be able to sell the shares unless certain other conditions are met. For example, we might have to increase the number of our authorized shares in order to issue the shares to Oasis Capital. Increasing the number of our authorized shares will require board and stockholder approval. Accordingly, because our ability to draw down any amounts under the Equity Purchase Agreement with Oasis Capital is subject to a number of conditions, there is no guarantee that we will be able to draw down all of the proceeds of $5,000,000 under the Equity Purchase Agreement.     CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     This prospectus may contain certain “forward-looking” statements as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases, which represent the registrant’s expectations or beliefs, including but not limited to, statements concerning the registrant’s operations, economic performance, financial condition, growth and acquisition strategies, investments, and future operational plans.

\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t           12   Table of Contents      USE OF PROCEEDS     We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling stockholder. However, we will receive proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to Oasis Capital under the Equity Purchase Agreement. We will use these proceeds for general corporate and working capital purposes, or for other purposes that our Board of Directors, in its good faith, deems to be in the best interest of our Company. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the offer and resale by the selling stockholder of the shares being offered hereby.     THE OFFERING     The selling stockholders may offer and resale of up to 250,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, pursuant to this prospectus.  All of such shares represent shares that Oasis Capital has agreed to purchase from us pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Equity Purchase Agreement we entered into with them on August 6, 2018 (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”), which are described below.      Equity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Oasis Capital, LLC     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we have the right to “put,” or sell, up to $5,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock to Oasis Capital.   Unless terminated earlier, Oasis Capital’s purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date on which Oasis Capital shall have purchased shares pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 or July 30, 2020. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the Equity Purchase Agreement. This arrangement is also sometimes referred to herein as the “Equity Line.”     As provided in the Equity Purchase Agreement, we may require Oasis Capital to purchase shares of common stock from time to time by delivering a put notice to Oasis Capital specifying the total number of shares to be purchased (such number of shares multiplied by the purchase price described below, the “Investment Amount”); provided there must be a minimum of ten trading days between delivery of each put notice. We may determine the Investment Amount, provided that such amount may not be more than 100% of the average daily trading volume in dollar amount for our common stock during the 5 trading days preceding the date on which we deliver the applicable put notice. Additionally, such amount may not be lower than $15,000 or higher than $500,000. Oasis Capital will have no obligation to purchase shares under the Equity Line to the extent that such purchase would cause Oasis Capital to own more than 9.99% of our common stock.     For each share of the our common stock purchased under the Equity Line, Oasis Capital will pay a purchase price equal to 85% of the “Market Price,” which is defined as the lowest closing traded price on the OTCQB Marketplace, as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P., during the five consecutive trading days following the date that Oasis Capital receives the respective Put Shares in its account, which in most circumstances will begin on the trading day immediately following the Put Date.  On the settlement date, Oasis Capital will purchase the applicable number of shares subject to customary closing conditions, including without limitation a requirement that a registration statement remain effective registering the resale by Oasis Capital of the shares to be issued under the Equity Line as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement described below.  The Equity Purchase Agreement is not transferable and any benefits attached thereto may not be assigned.      The Equity Purchase Agreement contains covenants, representations and warranties of us and Oasis Capital that are typical for transactions of this type. In addition, we and Oasis Capital have granted each other customary indemnification rights in connection with the Equity Purchase Agreement. The Equity Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time.     In connection with the Equity Purchase Agreement, we also entered into Registration Rights Agreement with Oasis Capital requiring us to prepare and file a registration statement registering the resale by Oasis Capital of shares to be issued under the Equity Line, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and to keep such registration statement effective until (i) three months after the last closing of a sale of shares under the Equity Line, (ii) the date when Oasis Capital may sell all the shares under Rule 144 without volume limitations, or (iii) the date Oasis Capital no longer owns any of the shares. In accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement, on April 25, 2019, we filed the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part registering the resale by Oasis Capital of up to 250,000,000 shares that may be issued and sold to Oasis Capital under the Equity Line. This registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on __________, 2019.         13   Table of Contents      The 250,000,000 shares being offered pursuant to this prospectus by Oasis Capital represent approximately 410% of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by non-affiliates of our Company as of the date of this prospectus.     The foregoing description of the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreements and instruments themselves, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 7, 2018 and incorporated into this prospectus by reference. The benefits and representations and warranties set forth in such agreements and instruments are not intended to and do not constitute continuing representations and warranties of the Company or any other party to persons not a party thereto.     We intend to sell Oasis Capital our common stock periodically under the Equity Purchase Agreement and Oasis Capital may, in turn, sell such shares to investors in the market at the market price or at negotiated prices. This may cause our stock price to decline, which will require us to issue increasing numbers of common shares to Oasis Capital to raise the intended amount of funds, as our stock price declines.     Likelihood of Accessing the Full Amount of the Equity Line     Notwithstanding that the Equity Line is in an amount of $5,000,000, we anticipate that the actual likelihood that we will be able access the full amount of the Equity Line is low due to several factors, including that our ability to access the Equity Line is impacted by our average daily trading volume, which may limit the maximum dollar amount of each put we deliver to Oasis Capital, and our stock price. Our use of the Equity Line will continue to be limited and restricted if our share trading volume or and market price of our stock continue at their current levels or decrease further in the future from the volume and stock prices reported over the past year. Further, if the price of our stock remains at $0.01 per share (which represents the average of the high and low reported sales prices of our common stock on December 31, 2018), the sale by Oasis Capital of all 250,000,000 of the shares registered in this prospectus would mean we would receive only $2,500,000 from our sale of shares under the Equity Line. Our ability to issue shares in excess of the 250,000,000 shares covered by the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part will be subject to our filing a subsequent registration statement with the SEC and the SEC declaring it effective.     In addition, we may have to increase the number of our authorized shares in order to issue shares to Oasis Capital in the future. Increasing the number of our authorized shares will require further board and stockholder approval. Accordingly, because our ability to deliver puts to Oasis Capital under the Equity Purchase Agreement is subject to a number of conditions, there is no guarantee that we will receive all or any portion of the $5,000,000 that is available to us under the Equity Line.     DIVIDEND POLICY     We have never paid or declared any dividends on our shares.  Moreover, even if future operations were to lead to significant levels of profits that would allow us to pay dividends, we currently intend to retain all available funds for reinvestment in our business.  Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made pursuant to a resolution by our board of directors, and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors and general meeting of shareholders may deem relevant.     DILUTION     “Dilution” represents the difference between the offering price of the shares of common stock and the net tangible book value per share of common stock immediately after completion of the offering. “Net tangible book value” is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities from total tangible assets. As of December 31, 2018, our Company had a negative book value of $(737,882) which represents approximately $(0.023) per share post-split, based upon shares outstanding of 31,886,289. This is due in part to shares of common stock issued upon conversion of certain promissory notes during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.      14   Table of Contents      Please refer to the section entitled “Interest of Management and others in Certain Transactions” for more information.  Assuming all shares offered are sold at an assumed offering price of $0.02 and in effect we receive the maximum estimated proceeds of this offering, our total shareholders’ equity will be approximately $ 3,512,118 and our net book value will be approximately $0.0124 per share. Therefore, any investor will incur an immediate dilution of approximately $(.0076) per share.  Our present shareholders will receive a decrease of $(.0101). This will result in a 62% decrease for 100% of offering.   If 10% of the offering is sold, any investor will incur an immediate dilution of approximately $(.0146) per share.  Our present shareholders will receive an increase of $.0171 per share.  This will result in a 76 % increase for 10% of the offering.  The following table illustrates the dilution to the purchaser of the common stock in this offering assuming the maximum proceeds or the minimum proceeds are raised and that the total outstanding shares at December 31, 2018 was 32,756,289 shares.        \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tThese numbers are calculated on Post Reverse 1 for 20 reverse split calculated at December 31, 2018

\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t% \\\\t\\\\t       Officers and Directors acquired 500,000 shares from providing of services or cash investment or both when the Company was founded.  Mr. O’Dowd, President and Director, acquired his initial 400,000 shares for $4,000 and has a cost per share of $.01 which was par value.  Mr. O’Dowd was a founder of the Company.  Mr. Marx, Director, purchased his initial 100,000 shares for $50,000 and this calculates to be $0.50 per share.  Thereafter, Mr. O’Dowd and Mr. Marx were issued 900,000 shares and 100,000 shares, respectively, in September 2017 and in August 2018, for services rendered. After completion of 100% of the offering Company officers, directors, promoters and affiliated persons will own less than 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock. After completion of 10% of the offering, Company officers, directors, promoters and affiliated persons will own 1.75% of the outstanding shares of common stock.     DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE     The Company will sell our shares at privately negotiated prices. See “Plan of Distribution”.       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS     OVERALL STRATEGIC DIRECTION     The Company is in the Photo Voltaic (PV) solar systems industry, the LED and energy efficient lighting business, energy efficient air conditioning service business and is an electrical product and services supplier.  The Company plans to build out a network of operations in major cities in the USA in order to establish a national base of PV suppliers, lighting suppliers, air conditioning equipment suppliers and electrical service operations centers.  This combination of services, solar, and electric, provides the Company with a solid base in the electrical services business and a solid base in the growth markets of solar industry.      15   Table of Contents         OVERVIEW     As of March 31, 2019, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year as funding becomes available. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. We remain committed to high quality operations.     DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS     ABCO sells and installs Solar Photovoltaic electric systems that allow the customer to produce their own power on their residence or business property.  These products, installed by our crews, are purchased from both USA and offshore manufacturers. We have available and utilize many suppliers of US manufactured solar products from such companies as Mia Soleil, Canadian Solar, Boviet, Westinghouse Solar and various Korean, German and Chinese suppliers.  In addition, we purchase from a number of local and regional distributors whose products are readily available and selected for markets and price.  ABCO offers solar leasing and long-term financing programs from Alternative Energy Finance Corporation, Service Finance Company, Green Sky, Sunrun and others that are offered to ABCO customers and other marketing and installation organizations.     ABCO also sells and installs energy efficient lighting products, solar powered street lights, HVAC equipment and lighting accessories. ABCO contracts directly with manufacturers to purchase its products which are sold to residential and commercial customers.     ABCO has Arizona statewide approval as a registered electrical services and solar products installer and as an HVAC dealer and installer. Our Solar Electric license is ROC 258378 and our HVAC license is ROC 323162 and we are fully licensed to offer commercial and residential throughout Arizona. As in all states, we will comply with all licensing requirements of those jurisdictions.     The ABCO subsidiary, Alternative Energy Finance Corporation (AEFC)a Wyoming Company provides funding for leases of photovoltaic systems. AEFC financed its owned leases from its own cash and now arranges financing with funds provided by investors and other lessors. AEFC has not done any new leases since 2011 but intends to do so as cash becomes available.     COMPETITION     The solar power market itself is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving.  Price and available financing are the principal methods of competition in the industry.  Based upon these two criteria, our position in the industry is relatively small.  There is no competitive data available to us in our competitive position within the industry.  Our competitors have established market positions more prominent than ours, and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish a successful distribution network, we may be unable to achieve sales and market share.  There are several major multi-national corporations that produce solar power products and participate in the solar development market place including, Sunpower, First Solar, GE, Mitsubishi, Solar World AG and Sanyo.  Also, established integrators are growing and consolidating, including GoSolar, Sunenergy and Real Good Solar and we expect that future competition will include new entrants to the solar power market.  Further, many of our competitors are developing and are currently producing products based on new solar power technologies that may have costs similar to or lower than our projected costs.     COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES     The Company believes that its key competitive advantages are:       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t1.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tThe ability to make decisions and use management’s many years of business experience to make the right decisions. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t2.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tExperience with National expansion programs by management. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t3.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tExperience with management of employee operated facilities from a central management office. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t4.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tExperience with multi-media promotional program for name recognition and product awareness. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t5.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAlternative energy is a fast growing and popular industry that relates well to customers and current or future shareholders that recognize the market, products and business focus. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t           16   Table of Contents         ADVANTAGES OF COMPETITORS OVER US     The Company believes the following are advantages of Competitors over us.       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t1.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLarger competitors have more capital. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t2.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLarger companies have more experience in the market. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t3.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLarger companies will get the larger contracts because of the level of experience. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t      \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t4.   \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tWe have the same products but must pay more because of volume.

We have developed the key messages and promotional pieces that are relevant to our business and inexpensive to produce.   We have built an informative and interactive web site that will allow people to assess their requirements and partially build and price a system, much like the automobile dealers utilize. Additional sales promotion will increase when we have secured outside financing or increased sales through direct sales efforts. Readers should review our website at www.abcosolar.com.     We have established a direct sales force to sell to Government agencies including State, Local and Federal resources and a separate division to call on the many American Indian governments in the US. This allows us to quote with our specifications, products and services on Requests for Proposals (RFP’s) that are issued by the Government Services Agency (GSA), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and other agencies. We have found that many projects are not known to the general public and most contractors because governmental agencies do not widely advertise their projects.  By departmentalizing this opportunity, we get more information on projects than is available in the normal course of business.     ABCO will not manufacture its solar voltaic (PV) products. We will continue to be a sales and installation contractor with plans to enter the markets of major US and international cities. We will sell and use commercial off the shelf components. Initially this will include the solar panels and LED lighting products purchased to our specification. A strong alliance with a well-respected distributor will be the most conservative decision for the company at this time.     ABCO will contract directly with manufacturers for it Solar Street Light products and will sell, install and maintain these products.  This product is considered to be an American Made product and therefore qualifies for various government funding programs.     Our business and the industry are reliant upon a number of state and federal programs to assist our customers in the acquisition of our products and services.  Such programs are the utility rebates paid directly to customers for wattage installations and the state and federal tax credit programs that allow a percentage of the actual cost of installations to be refunded in the form of tax credits.  Many states have mandated the utilities to collect funds from their customers for the payment of rebates.  All of these programs are listed on the website www.dsireusa.org.     Most of these programs are slated for expiration at differing times in the future.  The federal tax credit of 30% of installation cost will expire at the end of 2021. The customers benefit from the federal and state tax credits which pass through to the owners of the solar systems.  Investors often require the ownership to remain in their hands so that the tax credits can be passed through to them.  This results in a lesser amount to finance and a benefit to the lessee because it lowers the lease payments.  To the extent known, the curtailment or reduction of this tax credit will make a material change in our business and will very likely lower our sales prices and gross margins. Extension of the program or small reductions will probably not have a material effect on sales or gross margins because the suppliers will adjust to the new norm.  We again emphasize, we cannot predict any of the future or the outcome of unknowns. State rebate mandates and state tax credits are variable by state. All of these programs provide incentives for our customers that result in reduced cost.  The price of solar products has also been reduced drastically in the past five years which helping to balance the need for the subsidies.        17   Table of Contents         The State of Arizona subsidies are not material to our programs at this time. Since the State of Arizona offers only $1,000 tax credit per residential installation and no utility rebates for residential or commercial installations, this amount of credit is not likely to negatively impact our business because it will not materially affect the price of the installation.  This amount currently represents less than 2% of the price of an average residential installation.  The commercial tax credit is 10% of the installation price and capped at $25,000. We have not found this credit to be an adequate incentive for a buyer of a solar project to make a purchase decision and if not available, in our opinion, most sales would not be affected.     CUSTOMER BASE     Referrals are important in any market and time in business makes the customer base grow. No customer represented a significant percentage of the Company’s total revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 or in fiscal 2017.  The company believes that the knowledge, relationships, reputation and successful track record of its management will help it to build and maintain its customer base.     EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT     The Company believes that it has experienced management. ABCO’s principal, Charles O’Dowd, has ten years of experience in the sales and installation of solar products and more than forty years business experience.  Mr. O’Dowd has the ability and experience to attract and hire experienced and talented individuals to help manage the company.       Mr. Wayne Marx has been a member of the ABCO Board of Directors for eight years.  He also has over 40 years of self-employed business experience   The Company believes that long term business experience is our most valuable management tool.      ABCO has several experienced and long term employees on staff with a number of years of experience in provision of electrical services including lighting and solar installations. The Company believes that the knowledge, relationships, reputation and successful track record of its management will help it to build and maintain its customer base.     FINANCIAL RESOURCES     ABCO’s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through the sale of equity and capital contribution from shareholders.  We will continue to source capital from the equity and debt markets in order to fund our plans for expansion if we are unable to produce adequate capital from operations.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain adequate capital from these sources, or at all.     EMPLOYEES     The Company presently has 20 full-time employees, four (4) in management and four (4) in sales and the balance are in various labor crew positions. The Company anticipates that it will need to hire additional employees as the business grows. In addition, the Company may expand the size of our Board of Directors in the future.  Mr. O’Dowd devotes full time (40 plus hours) to the affairs of the Company.  No employees are represented by a union and there have not been any work stoppages.      18   Table of Contents      DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES     Capital Stock     Pursuant to our articles of incorporation, as amended to date, our authorized capital stock consists of 5,100,000,000 shares, comprised of 5,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of April 16, 2019, there were 61,492,630 shares of common stock and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the trading symbol “ABCE.”     The following description summarizes the material terms of our capital stock. This summary is, however, subject to the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws. For greater detail about our capital stock, please refer to our articles of incorporation and bylaws.     Common Stock     Voting.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of common stock owned by such stockholder on every matter properly submitted to the stockholders for their vote. Stockholders are not entitled to vote cumulatively for the election of directors. At any meeting of the stockholders, a quorum as to any matter shall consist of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except where a larger quorum is required by law, by our articles of incorporation or by our bylaws.     Dividend Rights.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably dividends and other distributions of cash or any other right or property as may be declared by our Board of Directors out of our assets or funds legally available for such dividends or distributions. The dividend rights of holders of common stock are subject to the dividend rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued and outstanding from time to time.     Liquidation Rights.  In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, holders of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of liabilities. If we have any preferred stock outstanding at such time, the holders of such preferred stock may be entitled to distribution and/or liquidation preferences that require us to pay the applicable distribution to the holders of preferred stock before paying distributions to the holders of common stock.     Conversion, Redemption and Preemptive Rights.  Holders of our common stock have no conversion, redemption, preemptive, subscription or similar rights.     The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is VStock Transfer, Inc.     Preferred Stock     Pursuant to our articles of incorporation, as amended to date, we are authorized to issue up to two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of preferred stock. We may issue such shares without stockholder action, from time to time, in one or more series, as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is expressly granted authority, within the limits set forth in the Nevada Revised Statutes, to:     (a)                designate, in whole or in part, the voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions, and relative rights of each class of shares before the issuance of any shares of that class;     (b)                create one or more series within a class of shares, fix the number of shares of each such series, and designate in whole or in part the voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions, and relative rights of the series, all before the issuance of any shares of that series; or     (c)                alter or revoke the preferences, limitations, and relative rights granted to or imposed upon any wholly-unissued class of shares or any wholly-unissued series of any class of shares.         19   Table of Contents      At this time, no Series A preferred stock are outstanding, 30,000,000 of Class B Preferred Stock are outstanding; and no shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding.     The Board of Directors of the Company had approved a reverse stock split of its common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-20 (the “Reverse Stock Split”).  The Reverse Stock Split became effective with FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and in the marketplace on December 23, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), whereupon the shares of common stock began trading on a split adjusted basis.  On the Effective Date, the Company’s trading symbol was changed to “ABCED” for a period of 20 business days, after which the “D” was removed from the Company’s trading symbol and it reverted to the original symbol of “ABCE”.  In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s CUSIP number changed to 00287V204. On the Effective Date, the total number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock held by each stockholder will be converted automatically into the number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held by such stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, divided by (ii) 20.  No fractional shares will be issued, and no cash or other consideration will be paid.  Instead, the Company will issue one whole share of the post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock to any stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share because of the Reverse Stock Split.     Anti-Takeover Provisions     Some features of the Nevada Revised Statutes, which are further described below, may have the effect of deterring third parties from making takeover bids for control of our company or may be used to hinder or delay a takeover bid.     This would decrease the chance that our stockholders would realize a premium over market price for their shares of common stock as a result of a takeover bid.     Acquisition of Controlling Interest     The Nevada Revised Statutes contain provisions governing acquisition of controlling interest of a Nevada corporation. These provisions provide generally that any person or entity that acquires a certain percentage of the outstanding voting shares of a Nevada corporation may be denied voting rights with respect to the acquired shares, unless the holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation, excluding shares as to which any of such acquiring person or entity, an officer or a director of the corporation, and an employee of the corporation exercises voting rights, elect to restore such voting rights in whole or in part. These provisions apply whenever a person or entity acquires shares that, but for the operation of these provisions, would bring voting power of such person or entity in the election of directors within any of the following three ranges:       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t20% or more but less than 33-1/3%; \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t33-1/3% or more but less than or equal to 50%; or \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tmore than 50%. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t       The stockholders or board of directors of a corporation may elect to exempt the stock of the corporation from these provisions through adoption of a provision to that effect in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not exempt our common stock from these provisions.        These provisions are applicable only to a Nevada corporation, which:       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\thas 200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom have addresses in Nevada appearing on the stock ledger of the corporation; and \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tdoes business in Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t       At this time, we do not believe that these provisions apply to acquisitions of our shares and will not until such time as these requirements have been met. At such time as they may apply to us, these provisions may discourage companies or persons interested in acquiring a significant interest in or control of our company, regardless of whether such acquisition may be in the interest of our stockholders.       20   Table of Contents         Combination with Interested Stockholder     The Nevada Revised Statutes contain provisions governing combination of a Nevada corporation that has 200 or more stockholders of record with an interested stockholder. As of December 31, 2018, we had 209 stockholders of record. Therefore, we believe that these provisions governing combination of a Nevada corporation apply to us and may have the effect of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company.     A corporation affected by these provisions may not engage in a combination within three years after the interested stockholder acquires his, her or its shares unless the combination or purchase is approved by the board of directors before the interested stockholder acquired such shares. Generally, if approval is not obtained, then after the expiration of the three-year period, the business combination may be consummated with the approval of the board of directors before the person became an interested stockholder or a majority of the voting power held by disinterested stockholders, or if the consideration to be received per share by disinterested stockholders is at least equal to the highest of:       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tthe highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the three years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or within three years immediately before, or in, the transaction in which he, she or it became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher; \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tthe market value per share on the date of announcement of the combination or the date the person became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher; or \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tif higher for the holders of preferred stock, the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock, if any. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t       Generally, these provisions define an interested stockholder as a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of a corporation. Generally, these provisions define combination to include any merger or consolidation with an interested stockholder, or any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of transactions with an interested stockholder of assets of the corporation having:       \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tan aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation; \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tan aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation; or \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t         \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t• \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\trepresenting 10% or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t       Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws     Our articles of incorporation contains provisions for “blank-check preferred stock” that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company and that would operate only with respect to an extraordinary corporate transaction involving our company, such as merger, reorganization, tender offer, sale or transfer of substantially all of its assets, or liquidation.

Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholder may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, provided such amounts are in compliance with FINRA Rule 2121. Discounts, concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, that can be attributed to the sale of common stock will be paid by the selling stockholder and/or the purchasers.     Oasis Capital, LLC is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Because Oasis Capital is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, it will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.     Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of securities of the common stock by the selling stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling security holders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale.      23   Table of Contents         Although Oasis Capital has agreed not to enter into any “short sales” of our common stock, sales after delivery of a put notice of a number of shares reasonably expected to be purchased under a put notice shall not be deemed a “short sale.” Accordingly, Oasis Capital may enter into arrangements it deems appropriate with respect to sales of shares of our common stock after it receives a put notice under the Equity Purchase Agreement so long as such sales or arrangements do not involve more than the number of put shares reasonably expected to be purchased by Oasis Capital under such put notice.      MARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS     Our common stock trades on the OTC Pink Market operated by the OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker symbol “ABCE.” The following table sets forth the range of high and low closing bid quotes of our common stock per quarter as reported by the OTC Markets for the past two fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and subsequent fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019. All quoted prices reflect inter-dealer prices without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. These prices reflect a one [1] for twenty [20] reverse stock split which became effective on December 23, 2018.          \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tQuarter Ended \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLow \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tHigh \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMarch 31, 2019 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.02000 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.02200 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDecember 31, 2018 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00820 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00870 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSeptember 30, 2018 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00060 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00070 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tJune 30, 2018 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00170 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00620 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMarch 31, 2018 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00260 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00550 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDecember 31, 2018 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00200 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00380 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSeptember 30, 2017 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00320 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00690 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tJune 30, 2017 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00410 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00900 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMarch 31, 2017 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.00500 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.02350 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDecember 31, 2017 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.01000 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t$ \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t.25000 \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t       Holders     As of March 31, 2019, there were 210 stockholders of record.     Dividends     We have not paid, nor declared, any cash dividends since our inception and do not intend to declare or pay any such dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay cash dividends is subject to limitations imposed by state law.     A VERY LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR SHARES     Effective April 8, 2019, our shares were listed on the OTCQB Market under the symbol ABCE.   As of April 16, 2019, the shares were last quoted at $. per share. On this date, the Company had approximately 210 shareholders of record.      The OTC Market Board® is maintained by the National Association of Securities Dealers (the NASD, now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)). The securities traded on the Bulletin Board are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, these securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Over-the-counter stocks are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.      24   Table of Contents      A purchaser of our shares may not be able to resell the shares. Broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they will be considered penny stocks and will be subject to the penny stock rules. Upon becoming a reporting company, Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on FINRA brokers-dealers who make a market in a “penny stock.” A penny stock generally includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited investor” (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer’s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks.  The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market, assuming one develops.     DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES TO BE REGISTERED  Capital Stock     We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate number of 5,000,000,000 shares of common capital stock, $0.001 par value per share.      On November 1, 2018, the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company, by written consent, without a shareholder meeting, authorized this increase from 2,000,000,000 to 5,000,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. The written consent authorized an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital to 5,000,000,000 common shares and 100,000,000 preferred shares. The amendment was filed with the State of Nevada on December 7, 2018.     The Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or series of stock, and the Board of Directors of the corporation, in accordance with Section 78.195 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, is vested with authority to prescribe the name, price, classes, series, and the number of each class or series of stock and the voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions, and relative rights of each class series of stock.  This corporation shall have one or more classes or series of stock that together (a) have voting rights and (b) are entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution.  All shares of stock shall be fully paid and non-assessable.     As of April 16, 2019, there were 61,482,630 shares issued and outstanding at a par value of $0.001 per share. Each share of common stock shall have one (1) vote per share for all purposes. The holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of our shareholders. Our capital stock does not provide a preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights. Our capital stock holders are not entitled to cumulative voting for election of the board of directors.     Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore, as well as any distributions to the security holder.  We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and do not expect to pay such dividends in the foreseeable future.     In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of capital stock are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets remaining after payment of liabilities. Holders of capital stock have no preemptive or other subscription or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the capital stock.      25   Table of Contents         Preferred Stock     We are authorized to issue shares of preferred stock.  The preferred stock may be divided into any number of series as our directors may determine from time to time. Our directors are authorized to determine and alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed upon any wholly issued series of preferred stock, and to fix the number of shares of any series of preferred stock and the designation of any such series of preferred stock. As of the date of this filing, we do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding.     Dividends     We have not paid any cash dividends to our common stock shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations.     Warrants and Options     There are no outstanding warrants to purchase our securities. There are no outstanding stock options to purchase our securities other than those hereinabove described.     Stock Transfer Agent     Our transfer agent is VStock Transfer, Inc., 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, NY 11598, telephone number 212-820-8436.         26   Table of Contents         MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements     This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include several forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate” and “continue,” or similar words.  Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and the management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.     Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Important factors not currently known to management could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.  We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time. We believe that our assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and business and operations of the Company.  No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions.  Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for our products, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.     RESULTS OF OPERATION     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017     The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contain certain statements that are not historical facts, including, among others, those relating to our anticipated financial performance for fiscal 2019, cash requirements, and our expected operating office openings. Only statements which are not historical facts are forward-looking and speak only as of the date on which they are made.  Information included in this discussion and analysis includes commentary on company-owned offices and sales volumes. Management believes such sales information is an important measure of our performance and is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of the ABCO Energy Business Model and the overall health of the Company.  All our financial information is reported in accordance with U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Such financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.      OVERVIEW     As of December 31, 2018, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company’s plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community.  Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition.  This will result in larger contracting jobs, statewide expansion and growth in revenue.  We remain committed to high quality operations.     Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses. Footnote 10 to the financial statements discloses the related party transactions of Officer, Directors and other related parties.      27   Table of Contents      FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017     Sales increased to $2,867,442 in 2018, an increase of $1,420,386 or 98% over 2017 sales of $1,447,056. Lack of funds and available staff has reduced our ability to a higher increase in sales but the status of the solar market political scene in Arizona has been harmful to the industry.  Our experience has shown us that there is going to be such pressure on our market, and we are changing to prevent the decreases in sales in the future.  We have added new products and new sales personnel and intend to find merger and acquisition funding and acquisition or merger candidates during the current year.  There is no assurance that ABCO will be able to accomplish these goals in the coming year.      Cost of sales increased by $888,746, or 77% to $2,040,339 in 2018 from $1,151,593 in 2017 due primarily to the increase in sales. The Company also changed its focus from residential installs to a commercial focus in order to meet changes in the market. Gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 29% in 2018 from 20% in 2017, primarily due to better management of costs on our large commercial jobs in 2018. We hope to bid these contracts more favorably in the future to prevent negative cost of sales numbers.  We hope that more efficient production and a sales mix shift to the higher profit commercial market emphasis will improve these numbers.     General and administrative expenses increased by $182,403, or 22%, in 2018 from $834,457 in 2017 due primarily to maintaining the administration staff in order to control operations, to train and hire additional sales force and to administer public company expenses in 2018.  An 98% increase in sales revenue is the main reason administrative expenses increased in 2018.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for carrying cost of accounts receivable and inventory during and after completion of contracts. This process can easily exceed 90 days and requires the contractor to pay all or most of the cost of the project without assistance from suppliers. Our working capital at December 31, 2018 was $(768,960) and it was $(1,140,059) at December 31, 2017. This increase of $371,099 was primarily funded by our private equity offerings. Bank financing has not been available to the Company.  Working capital calculations include the effect of derivative liabilities in the amount of $74,848 for 2018, a reduction from $178,013 at December 31, 2017.     ABCO Energy has very little contracted lease obligations or long term debt. Our long-term debt net of current portion totaled $18,670 at December 31, 2018 and $0 at December 31, 2017.  The Company owed Officers and Directors $169,549 and $187,826 respectively on demand notes.     STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS     During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 our net cash used in operating activities was $347,325 and $167,739 respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in the period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted primarily of net loss from operations adjusted for non-cash expenses and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and mainly the changes in the results of operations.     Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $(10,863) and $(197) respectively due to acquisitions of equipment and deposits on leased real estate. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $420,850 and $160,448 respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2018 and 2017, resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock. Cash flows from Financing Activities were reduced by legal and the costs of the SEC filings, including the preparation of a Schedule 14A proxy statement, preparation of two Schedule 14C statements, and other SEC expenses that aggregated a total of $39,176.     Since our inception on August 8, 2008 through December 31, 2018 we have incurred net losses of $(5,180,431), including the effects of derivatives on convertible debt totaling $1,465,597. Our cash and cash equivalent balances were $67,707 and $5,046 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.  At December 31, 2018, we had total liabilities of $1,198,688 as opposed to $1,230,217 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $31,529.   The changes in excess billings on contracts in progress account for the majority of the difference.      We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements – primarily the working capital required for the marketing of our services and to offset legal and accounting fees – by additional financing and more operations income. This will likely be in the form of future debt or equity financing.  Based on our current operating plan, we have sufficient working capital to sustain operations for the short term if we do not expand our business. We will not however, be able to reach our goals and projections for multistate expansion without a cash infusion. We expect that our revenue will increase at a steady pace and that this volume of business will result in profitable operations in the future.      28   Table of Contents      OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS     The Company has no off balance sheet transactions during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Company Overview  We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global (excluding Central & Eastern Europe plus other territories) development and commercialization of cytisinicline for smoking cessation. Our focus is to address the global smoking health epidemic. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for nearly seven million deaths annually worldwide.  Cytisinicline is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by Sopharma AD for over 20 years under the brand name Tabex™. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisinicline to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014, respectively.   Cytisinicline is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisinicline is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic binding to nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking through antagonistic properties.  Investigational New Drug, or IND-enabling, non-clinical toxicology studies were sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, division of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, in addition to the National Cancer Institute. In June 2017, we filed our IND application for cytisinicline with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which included NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies. Additional NDA-enabling, non-clinical reproductive toxicology studies are also being conducted by NCCIH, two such studies have already been submitted to the IND with a third study to be submitted upon completion. Cytisinicline Development In August 2017, we initiated a clinical study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisinicline in normal healthy volunteers. We completed the food effect study and announced the results in November of 2017 demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisinicline in fed and fasted subjects. In October 2017, we initiated a study assessing the repeat-dose Pharmacokinetics, or PK, and Pharmacodynamics, or PD, effects of 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg cytisinicline in 36 healthy volunteer smokers when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment. Of the 36 subjects, 24 were to be 18-65 years and 12 were to be greater than 65 years of age. Final results were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, or SRNT, in February 2019. The study randomized a total of 26 subjects. This included only 2 of the intended 12 subjects greater than age 65, due to difficulty enrolling within this age group.  All 26 subjects completed the study. Predictable increases in plasma cytisinicline concentrations were observed with increasing unit dosing from 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date. Overall, subjects had an 80% reduction in cigarettes smoked, 82% reduction in expired carbon monoxide, and 46% of the subjects achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Subjects who received 3.0 mg cytisinicline over the 25 days had a trend for higher smoking abstinence compared to subjects who received 1.5 mg cytisinicline. The adverse events observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event. No severe or serious adverse events were observed in the study. 2    In December 2017, we initiated a series of drug metabolism, drug-to-drug interaction, and transporter studies of cytisinicline and results from these studies were announced in June 2018. These studies demonstrated that cytisinicline has no clinically significant interaction with any of the hepatic enzymes commonly responsible for drug metabolism nor clinically significant interaction with drug transporters. This suggests that cytisinicline may be administered with other medications without the need to modify the dose of any co-administered medications. We will continue to evaluate for any new FDA guidance on whether additional drug-to-drug interactions studies will be required prior to a future New Drug Application, or NDA, filing. We have met with the FDA and with other national regulatory authorities in Europe to identify the steps required for the approval of cytisinicline. We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in May 2018 to review and receive guidance on our Phase 3 clinical program and overall development plans for cytisinicline to support an NDA. This review included submitted results from non-clinical studies, standard drug-to-drug interaction and reproductive/teratogenicity studies. Detailed plans for chronic toxicology, carcinogenicity studies, and additional human studies regarding renal impairment, QT interval prolongation, longer term exposure and adequate demonstration of safety and efficacy from our planned randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials were also discussed. A new cytisinicline tablet with improved shelf life has been formulated and recently launched commercially by Sopharma in their territories. In May 2018, we initiated a study to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisinicline in volunteer smokers using this new formulation and data results were announced in September 2018. The study demonstrated similar bioavailability of cytisinicline in fed and fasted subjects. Cytisinicline was extensively absorbed after oral administration with maximum cytisinicline concentration levels observed in the blood within less than two hours with or without food. Total excretion levels of cytisinicline also remained equivalent in both the fed and fasted states, and the 3.0 mg dose of this new formulation of cytisinicline was well tolerated. In December 2018, we announced that FDA was in agreement with our Initial Pediatric Study Plan, specifically, providing a full waiver for evaluating cytisinicline in a pediatric population. The reasons for the full waiver were based on the low numbers of children smoking under the age of 12 and the logistical difficulties of recruiting treatment-seeking smokers in the adolescent age group. The agreed Pediatric Study Plan is expected to be included as part of our future application for marketing approval of cytisinicline. In March 2019, we initiated a trial to assess the dose limiting adverse events that would define the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for a single administered oral dose of cytisinicline. This study is being performed in smokers who receive one single dose of cytisinicline. The starting dosage of cytisinicline was 6 mg and is increased in separate groups of subjects for each escalated dose level until stopping criteria (based on the occurrence of dose-limiting adverse events) are reached. A safety review after each dose level is performed by an independent Data Safety Monitor Committee, or DSMC, before escalation to the next dose level. Six dose levels were pre-planned with 21 mg cytisinicline as the highest dose level. To date, 21mg cytisinicline has been evaluated without evidence of dose limiting toxicity. The DSMC has recommended that the protocol be amended to evaluate additional higher doses in order to define the dose limiting adverse events, or MTD, for cytisinicline. This Phase-1 study is a requirement for our future application for marketing approval of cytisinicline. In June 2019, we announced positive top line results for the Phase 2b ORCA-1 trial and the dose selection of 3.0 mg, TID for our Phase 3 development. ORCA-1 is the first in our ORCA (Ongoing Research of Cytisinicline for Addiction) Program that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cytisinicline for smoking cessation and potentially other indications.  ORCA-1 was initiated in October 2018 and evaluated 254 smokers in the United States, or U.S. The trial evaluated both the 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg doses of cytisinicline on the standard declining titration schedule as well as a more simplified three times daily (TID) dosing schedule, both over 25 days. The trial was randomized and blinded to compare the effectiveness of the cytisinicline doses and schedules to respective placebo groups. All subjects were treated for 25 days, including behavioral support, and followed up for a further four weeks.  The primary endpoint in the study was the reduction in daily smoking, a self-reported measure. Three of the four cytisinicline treatment arms demonstrated a statistically significant improvement, p < 0.05, compared to placebo  3    arms. The fourth arm trended to significance (p= 0.052). Across all treatment arms, over the 25-day treatment period, subjects on cytisinicline experienced a 74-80% median reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, compared to a 62% reduction in the placebo arms.  The secondary endpoint of the trial was a 4-week continuous abstinence rate, which is the relevant endpoint for regulatory approval. All cytisinicline treatment arms showed significant improvements in abstinence rates compared to the placebo arms. The most impressive results were observed in the 3.0 mg TID cytisinicline arms which demonstrated a 54% abstinence rate at week 4, compared to 16% for placebo (p < 0.0001) and a continuous abstinence rate, weeks 5 through 8, of 30% for cytisinicline compared to 8% for placebo (p= 0.005).  At week 4, all four cytisinicline arms demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.05) reductions in expired carbon monoxide (CO), a biochemical measure of smoking activity. Expired CO levels had declined by a median of 71-80% in the cytisinicline treatment arms, compared to only 38% in the placebo arms. The lack of consistency in the reduction of expired CO levels compared to the self-reported data suggest potential under-reporting of cigarettes smoked by subjects on placebo.  Cytisinicline was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. The most commonly reported (>5%) adverse events (AEs) across all cytisinicline treatment arms versus placebo arms were abnormal dreams, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infections, and nausea. In the 3 mg TID treatment arm versus placebo arms, the most common AEs were abnormal dreams, insomnia, and constipation (each 6% vs 2%), upper respiratory tract infections (6% vs 14%), and nausea (6% vs 10%), respectively. Compliance with study treatment was greater than 94% across all arms.   The Company expects to conduct further analyses of the ORCA-1 trial and will provide additional data for presentation at future medical meetings. Additionally, Achieve plans to discuss the trial’s outcome with the FDA and finalize Phase 3 protocol details in the second-half of 2019.

U.S.     Federal Income Tax Considerations           It     is the opinion of our outside counsel, Eilenberg & Krause LLP, that the distribution of Rights to U.S. holders of our     Common Stock or of rights to acquire shares of our Common Stock should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as     a non-taxable distribution under Section 305(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),     and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.  However, there is a lack of authority addressing the application     of the Code to distributions of Rights and your receipt of Rights may be treated as a taxable distribution.  We urge     you to consult with your own tax advisor regarding the facts and circumstances of your own tax situation.  See, “Risk     Factors—The receipt of Rights may be treated as a taxable distribution to you.”  See also, “Material     U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”                         Subscription     Agent           American     Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, will act as our Subscription Agent in connection with the Rights Offering.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OFFERING     The following are examples of common questions that we expect to receive from securityholders and their representatives regarding our Rights Offering. The following questions and answers are inherently limited in scope and do not contain all of the information that may be important to you and may not address all of the questions that you may have about the Rights Offering. This prospectus and the documents that we incorporate by reference herein contain many details regarding the terms and conditions of our Rights Offering and provide additional information about us and our business, including potential risks related to subscribing for shares in our Rights Offering, the shares of our Common Stock and our business.            8                 What is the Rights Offering?     The Rights Offering is our distribution, at no charge, to holders of our outstanding Common Stock and to certain holders of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock, of non-transferable Rights to purchase additional shares of our Common Stock. The price for exercise of the Rights and subscription for the purchase of shares of our Common Stock is $[         ] per whole share, which was set by our Board of Directors based on a [         ]% discount [expected to be between 15% and 20%] to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the record date. There is no charge to securityholders related to the distribution of the Rights. All references in this prospectus to the Rights Offering subscription price of $[         ] per share refer to the price per whole share.     Why are we conducting the Rights Offering?     We are conducting the Rights Offering to finance our contemplated reacquisition of the outstanding 20% minority interest in our OmniMetrix LLC subsidiary and to support the growth of our OmniMetrix business, with any net proceeds not so utilized to be used for general working capital purposes. See the section of this prospectus under the caption: “Use of Proceeds.”     Who may participate in our Rights Offering?     Only securityholders of our Company as of 5:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time on the record date of [           ], 2019, may participate in the Rights Offering.     How many Rights will I receive?     On the record date, we will grant you one (1) Right for each one (1) share of our Common Stock you hold as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, on [           ], 2019, the record date for the Rights Offering. If you hold warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock, you will also receive one (1) Right for each one (1) share of our Common Stock that you could purchase as of 5:00 p.m. EDT on the record date by exercising your warrants. You will not need to exercise your warrants in order to receive Rights. Each Right will entitle you to purchase [           ] of a share of our Common Stock at a subscription price of $[           ] per whole share. At your own choosing, you may exercise some or all of your Rights. You may also elect not to exercise any Rights at all.     How many warrantholders are receiving Rights?     Under the terms of certain of our outstanding warrants, the warrantholders have the right to receive the Rights being distributed in the Rights Offering, based on the number of shares of our Common Stock they could purchase as of the record date by exercising their warrants. As of the record date, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 2,357,142 shares of our Common Stock for which the warrantholders will receive Rights. Warrantholders will not need to exercise their warrants in order to receive Rights.     Will fractional shares of Common Stock be issued upon exercise of the Rights?     No. We will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock. If you exercise your Rights in a manner that would result in the issuance of fractions of a share, the number of shares that you may purchase will be rounded down to the nearest share.     What if I own my stock through a brokerage account or similar nominee account?     If you hold your shares in the name of a broker, dealer, bank or other nominee and you wish to participate in the Rights Offering and purchase shares of our Common Stock, please contact your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee as soon as possible. You should complete and return to your nominee the form captioned: “Beneficial Owner Election Form.” You should receive the form from your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee with the other Rights Offering materials.

The subscription price was determined by our Board of Directors on the basis of a [ ]% discount [expected to be between 15% and 20%] to the closing price of our Common Stock on the record date. In making its determination, the Board considered many factors, including the historical and current trading prices of our Common Stock, as well as current trends and conditions in capital markets. The subscription price was not determined on the basis of any investment bank or third-party valuation that was commissioned by our company. The Board of Directors reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to change the subscription price of the Rights Offering or determine to cancel or otherwise alter the terms of the Rights Offering. See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “The Rights Offering—Expiration Date, Extension, and Amendments.”     May I transfer my Rights?     No. The Rights are not transferable by you. You may not sell, give away or otherwise transfer your Rights. However, Rights may be assigned to family members or family trusts. The Rights are also subject to transfer by operation of law (such as testate or intestate succession). The sale of any of your shares of Common Stock prior to the expiration of the Rights Offering period will not result in the transfer of any Rights.     Are there any limitations on the number of my Rights that I may exercise?     There are no restrictions on the number of your Rights that you may exercise. At your own choosing, you may exercise some or all of your Rights. You may also elect not to exercise any Rights at all.     When can I exercise my Rights?     You may exercise your Rights at any time commencing on the effective date of this prospectus and ending at the expiration time and date of the Rights Offering period, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on [          ], 2019, which is [         ] calendar days after the effective date of this prospectus.

If your subscription exercise documentation is received by the Subscription Agent after the expiration of the Rights Offering period, we may, in our sole discretion, make an accommodation to accept your subscription, but we shall not be under any obligation to do so.     See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “The Rights Offering” for further information regarding the requirements and procedures for exercising your Rights.     If you hold your shares through a broker, dealer, bank, or other nominee, your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee holder may impose separate deadlines prior to the expiration of the Rights Offering. In such case, if you wish to participate in the Rights Offering, we urge you to contact your broker, dealer, bank, or other nominee and coordinate all procedures with them as soon as reasonably possible.     How do I exercise my Rights?     If you wish to participate in the Rights Offering, you must deliver to the Subscription Agent before the expiration of the Rights Offering, all of the following which the Subscription Agent must receive (and funds must clear) prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on [         ], 2019, which is [         ] calendar days after the effective date of this prospectus:                 1.     Your     payment for exercise of the Rights.  See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “The Rights Offering—Method     of Exercising Rights” and “The Rights Offering—Form of Payment.”                               2.     Your     complete and fully executed Rights certificate.            10                 If you cannot deliver your Rights certificate to the Subscription Agent before the expiration of the Rights Offering, you may use the procedures for guaranteed delivery as described in this prospectus in the section under the caption: “The Rights Offering—Guaranteed Delivery Procedures.”     If you hold your shares through your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, complete and return to such broker, dealer, bank or other nominee the form captioned: “Beneficial Owner Election Form” or use the forms provided to you by your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee in accordance with their stated procedures and prior to their stated deadlines.     Where do I deliver my forms and the payment for exercise of the Rights?     If your shares are held in the name of a broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, then you must coordinate with your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee regarding delivery of your subscription documents, Rights certificate, notice of guaranteed delivery (if applicable) and your subscription payment.     If you are a stockholder of record, or hold warrants, and you wish to exercise your Rights, then you must send your subscription documents, Rights certificate, notices of guaranteed delivery (if applicable) and subscription payment to the Subscription Agent at the following address: [                            ]     All deliveries to the Subscription Agent should only be made by registered first class mail or overnight courier service. Please allow adequate time for delivery of your subscription to the Subscription Agent by you or by your broker, dealer, custodian bank or other nominee, as applicable.     We do not take any responsibility for completion of your subscription documents, Rights certificate and payment to the Subscription Agent or, if you are not a record holder to your broker, dealer, custodian bank or other nominee. If you wish to exercise your Rights, please assure that you properly complete all documents and that you provide responses to all requested information. If you have any questions or comments regarding completion of the materials, please contact the Information Agent.     If the payment you remit does not cover the total purchase price for the number of shares of Common Stock for which you are subscribing, or if the number of shares of Common Stock for which you are subscribing is not properly specified, then the funds will be applied to the exercise of Rights only to the extent of the payment actually received by the Subscription Agent.     After I deliver my payment and Rights certificate, may I cancel my exercise of Rights?     No. Except in the event we make a fundamental change to the terms and conditions of the Rights Offering, all exercises of Rights are irrevocable, even if you later change your mind. The irrevocability of your exercise will apply even if new information comes to your attention or if the market price of our Common Stock falls below the Rights Offering subscription price of $[    ] per share. Your exercise of the Rights will also remain irrevocable if the authorized period for the Rights Offering is extended by our Board of Directors. See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “The Rights Offering—No Revocation or Change.”     What if I do not exercise my Rights?     In addition to the holders of our [    ] shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date, we are distributing Rights to holders of outstanding warrants to purchase an additional 2,357,142 shares of our Common Stock. Warrantholders will not need to exercise their warrants in order to receive Rights. As a result, the total number of Rights distributed will exceed the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding on the record date. This means that even if you exercise all of your Rights, your percentage ownership of our Common Stock will likely decrease and your voting and other equity rights will be diluted by the issuance of shares in the Rights Offering to subscribers and the Backstop Purchasers. The more of your Rights you exercise, the less your voting and other equity rights will be diluted. If you do not exercise your Rights before the expiration of the Rights Offering period your Rights will automatically terminate.            11                 Are there risks in exercising my Rights?     Yes. You must carefully consider all known risks of investment prior to the exercise of your Rights. The risks of investment loss apply to all subscribers. We cannot provide any assurance that the shares of our Common Stock sold at the Rights Offering subscription price of $[          ] per share will in the future maintain their value or increase in value. You should carefully read this entire prospectus and consider all of the risks described in the section of this prospectus under the caption: “Risk Factors.” You should also carefully review documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus. See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “Incorporation of Certain Information by Reference.”     How are the shares of Common Stock delivered?     At the completion of the Rights Offering, we will issue the shares of Common Stock in book-entry form to each subscriber. We will not issue any stock certificates. If you are a holder of record of our Common Stock or hold warrants, shortly after the expiration of the Rights Offering you will receive a statement of ownership from our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, reflecting the shares of Common Stock that you have purchased in the Rights Offering. If your shares of Common Stock are held in the name of a broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, your shares of Common Stock will be issued to the same account. You may request a statement of ownership from the broker or nominee following the completion of the Rights Offering.     Will my subscription payment be refunded to me if the Rights Offering is not completed?     Yes. If the we do not complete the Rights Offering, all subscription payments received by the Subscription Agent will be returned, without penalty or interest, as soon as reasonably possible. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, the Subscription Agent will return the payment to the broker, dealer, bank or other nominee holding your shares.     If I live outside the United States does that affect my exercise of Rights?     For purposes of assuring that we will not breach the laws of any country outside of the United States, we will not mail this prospectus or the Rights certificates to securityholders whose addresses are outside the United States or who have an army post office or foreign post office address. The Subscription Agent will hold the Rights certificates on behalf of such securityholders. If you live outside of the United States and wish to exercise your Rights, you must notify the Subscription Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on [          ], 2019, which is [          ] business days prior to the expiration date of the Rights Offering. See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “The Rights Offering—Foreign Stockholders.”     Will any fees or charges apply to me if I exercise my Rights?     If you wish to exercise your Rights, the only cost to you will be the payment of the subscription price for purchase of the Rights Offering shares. We will not charge any fees or commissions in connection with the issuance of the Rights to you or the exercise of your Rights for Rights Offering shares. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, you may be required to pay the broker or nominee certain service or administration fees in connection with the exercise of your Rights. Please check with your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee in such regard. We are not responsible for covering or reimbursing any such fees.            12                 What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising Rights?     It is the opinion of our outside counsel, Eilenberg & Krause LLP, that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our U.S. securityholders should not be subject to recognition of income or loss in connection with the receipt or exercise of Rights. However, there is a lack of authority directly addressing the application of the Internal Revenue Code to distributions of Rights and your receipt of Rights may be treated as a taxable distribution. We therefore recommend that you consult with your own tax advisor regarding your own specific tax situation and to assess the potential adverse tax consequences resulting from the receipt and exercise of Rights and the receipt, ownership and disposition of Common Stock. See, “Risk Factors—The receipt of Rights may be treated as a taxable distribution to you.” See also, “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”     Will our directors, officers, or any significant stockholders participate in the Rights Offering?     Our directors and officers who own shares of our Common Stock as of the record date will be eligible to participate in the Rights Offering. Pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, Michael Osterer (one of our Directors) and Gary Mohr (one of our Directors) have agreed to exercise in full all of the Rights distributed for the shares of Common Stock that they beneficially own. In addition, Jan H. Loeb, our President and CEO and the sole manager of Backstop Purchaser Leap Tide, has agreed to exercise all of his Rights in full. Other than these three officers and directors, we have not received any indication from any of our directors, officers or other stockholders as to whether they plan to subscribe for shares of our Common Stock in the Rights Offering.     How many shares of our Common Stock will be outstanding after the Rights Offering?     As of the record date, we had [          ] shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding. We are offering up to [          ] shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. In reliance on the Backstop Agreement, we expect to issue all of the shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. We therefore anticipate that if we complete the Rights Offering, we will have an aggregate of [          ] shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding following completion of the Rights Offering.     Can we extend, cancel or amend the Rights Offering?     Yes. We reserve the right to extend the Rights Offering period for a period not to exceed [          ] calendar days. If we decide to extend the Rights Offering period, we will issue a press release announcing the extension in advance of the expiration of the then-effective Rights Offering period. We may also extend the duration of the Rights Offering period if applicable law or regulations require us to do so. Our Board of Directors has broad discretion regarding any and all determinations whether or not to extend the Rights Offering period. The Board of Directors may also cancel the Rights Offering at any time before the expiration of the Rights Offering for any reason. In addition, we may amend or modify the terms of the Rights Offering for any reason. See the section in this prospectus under the caption: “The Rights Offering—Expiration Date, Extension, and Amendments.”     What happens if the Rights Offering is not fully subscribed by our securityholders?     We have entered into a Backstop Agreement with Leap Tide Capital Management LLC (“Leap Tide”), Michael Osterer (one of our Directors) and Gary Mohr (one of our Directors and, together with Leap Tide and Mr. Osterer, the “Backstop Purchasers”), pursuant to which each Backstop Purchaser has agreed to exercise its/his Rights in full in the Rights Offering and, upon expiration of the Rights Offering, to purchase from the Company, at the price per share equal to the subscription price of $[ ] per share, any and all shares of Common Stock that other securityholders do not subscribe for in our Rights Offering, subject to the respective terms, conditions and limitations of the Backstop Agreement. The Backstop Purchasers’ obligations under the Backstop Agreement are subject to various conditions as described in the section of this prospectus under the caption: “The Backstop Agreement.”            13                 Why are there Backstop Purchasers?     Our objective is to raise the full $2,400,000 in gross proceeds from our Rights Offering. In the event that all Rights are not exercised, we would fall short of that objective. We have therefore obtained a commitment from the Backstop Purchasers in order to establish a higher likelihood of receiving the full amount of our Rights Offering objective.     Will the Backstop Purchasers receive any compensation for entering into the Backstop Agreement?     No. The Backstop Purchasers will not receive any compensation for entering into the Backstop Agreement.     Are there any conditions to the Backstop Purchasers’ obligations under the Backstop Agreement?     Yes. The obligations of the Backstop Purchasers to consummate the transactions under the Backstop Agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, including, but not limited to, compliance with covenants and the accuracy of various representations and warranties set forth in the Backstop Agreement.     How will the Rights Offering affect the ownership of our largest beneficial owners?     As of the record date, Michael Osterer, one of our Directors, beneficially owned approximately [    ]% of our Common Stock, and Jan H. Loeb, our President and CEO, beneficially owned approximately [    ]% of our Common Stock. No other stockholders beneficially owned more than 1% of our Common Stock as of the record date. Upon the closing of the Rights Offering and consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Backstop Agreement, Mr. Osterer would beneficially own approximately [    ]% of our Common Stock, and Mr. Loeb would beneficially own approximately [     ]% of our Common Stock.     Whom should I contact if I have other questions?     If you have other questions or need assistance, please contact our Information Agent at: [                         ].     '},\n",

Business Overview   Organized in 1986, we have spent the last decade focusing on the acquisition and development of existing businesses. Currently, our management has been exclusively exploring potential acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products such as beverages, muscle/joint rubs, oils, crystals, tinctures, bath bombs, isolate, relief balms, elixirs, body washes, med sticks, lotions, vape pens and cartridges, shatter, and gummies (a “CBD-Infused Products Company”). We own a minority interest in CBD-infused beverage maker Ablis Holding Company (“Ablis HC” or “Ablis”), and of craft distillers Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits and Bend Spirits, Inc. We have letters of intent to acquire CBD Lion LLC and Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids.   In order to consummate a particular acquisition of a CBD-Infused Products Company, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are related to such CBD-Infused Products Company, for example, operating businesses and/or assets involving distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, paraphernalia, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-infused products, and real estate.      Corporate Information   Acquired Sales Corp. is a Nevada corporation incorporated on January 2, 1986 that engages in the operation of seeking, structuring and seeking to execute on acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products.

Total Common stock outstanding before this offering 2,586,669 shares of common stock       Use of proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Shares covered by this prospectus.  We will not receive proceeds from the exercise of the preferred stock if exercised.  See “Use of Proceeds”.       Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. For a discussion of factors to consider before deciding to invest in our securities, you should carefully review and consider the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus beginning on page 9 of this prospectus.            The number of shares of our common stock that will be outstanding immediately before this offering is based on 2,586,669 shares of common stock outstanding as of July 26, 2019, and does not include, as of that date:    •4,376,869 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $1.19 per share as of July 26, 2019; and    •        6,615,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Preferred Stock.     RISK FACTORS   Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our securities. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment.   Risk Factors Relating to Our Company   An investment in the securities offered hereby is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk and should be made only by investors who can afford to lose their entire investment.  Acquired Sales Corp. expects (but cannot be guaranteed) in 2019 to purchase all of CBD Lion LLC, all of Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids (“Lifted Liquids” or “Lifted”), and has the right to acquire up to 19.99% of each of Ablis Holding Company, Bend Spirits, Inc. and Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits. Acquired Sales Corp. will  only be positioned to receive any potential financial benefit from Ablis Holding Company, Bend Spirits, Inc. and Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits if the equity acquisitions occur and they, in turn, subsequently pay dividends or if they are sold to a third party, neither of which is guaranteed to occur. The description of the Company’s business and financial condition is contained in the Company’s SEC filings at www.sec.gov. This Agreement does not contain all of the risk factors that may relate to the Company’s operations. Other risk factors are set out in Acquired Sales Corp.’s Form 10-K filed on March 13, 2019 and are incorporated by reference herein. Prospective investors, prior to making any investment decision should carefully consider along with other matters referred to herein those risk factors.   Because we have a limited operating history, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve profitability.   We have a limited operating history with respect to our CBD related operations upon which you can evaluate our prospects and our potential value. Prior to that, we have not been profitable during most of our years of operation. We face many risks that could prevent us from achieving profits in future years. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Our potential acquisitions of CBD Lion LLC and Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids, if those acquisitions occur, and our acquisition of up to 19.99% of the outstanding equity of each of Ablis Holding Company, Bend Spirits, Inc., Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits, CBD Lion LLC and Lifted Liquids involve significant risk, and there can be no assurance that the business of Ablis Holding Company, Bend Spirits, Inc. and Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits will be successful or generate any profit or other financial benefit. An inability by Acquired Sales Corp. to achieve financial benefit from Ablis Holding Company, Bend Spirits, Inc.,  Bendistillery Inc., CBD Lion LLC or Lifted Liquids could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading  9  price of our Stock.   We have incurred substantial losses in the past and it may be difficult to achieve profitability   We have a history of losses and are anticipated to incur additional losses in the development of our business. For the three  months ended March 31, 2019, we had a net loss of ($44,440). As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 we had an accumulated deficit of ($14,068,681) and ($14,005,689), respectively. There exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We intend to continue to invest in the CBD space, including by hiring additional personnel, upgrading our management systems and integrating several businesses into or as a part of our operations. To the extent we are successful in integrating several businesses into our operations, we may also incur increased losses in the short term because costs associated with these activities are expected to commence in advance of service and transactional revenues at future dates if at all. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenues enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this section, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon continuing to generate profits from operations in the future and/or our ability to obtain necessary financing required to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations. We intend to finance our operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, cash from operations, debt financings, and/or the sale of equity which we may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor sentiment. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail or cease our operations.   Our Chief Executive Officer is not required to work full-time and he and our President and CFO are entitled to significant bonus compensation   Our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, runs our operations on a part-time basis and is compensated with equity. Mr. Gerard M. Jacobs has not historically received cash compensation and William “Jake” Jacobs, President and CFO, has worked for approximately $5,000 per month. However, effective as of June 19, 2019 through the earlier of the closing of the Company\\\\\\'s acquisition of CBD Lion LLC or the closing of the Company\\\\\\'s acquisition of Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids, the Company has agreed to pay Gerard M. Jacobs, and William “Jake” Jacobs, consulting fees of $7,500 per month and $5,000 per month, respectively. In addition, upon the closing of one or more of the acquisitions described above, the salaries, equity incentives, expense reimbursements and bonuses will increase. There are also to be significant bonuses awarded to the CEO and CFO in the event the Company closes on the acquisitions of CBD Lion LLC and Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids, and in the event that the Company raises $15 million and $25 million. Some or all of these additional Company expenses, bonuses and compensation may be funded by this Financing. For a further description of the proposed compensation arrangements, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K, and its exhibit, filed with the SEC on or about June 25, 2019.   Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our revenue   Costs resulting from changes in or new income taxes, value added taxes, service taxes, sales and use taxes, or other taxes may adversely affect our margins. These costs could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Tax interpretations and changes in tax regulations and legislation could adversely affect us   Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities.  Tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us that may be challenged by the applicable taxation authorities upon audit.  Although we believe our assumptions, judgements and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.   On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions, and credits, limited the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct interest expense, and transitioned to a territorial tax system which allows for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. with a 100% federal dividends received deduction prospectively. In addition, the Tax Act required a one-time transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings. Several of the new provisions enacted as part of the Tax Act require clarification and guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and Treasury Department. These or other changes in U.S. tax laws could impact our profits, effective tax rate, and cash flows.   We have accumulated net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from our operations and foreign and domestic acquisitions of approximately $2.1 million as of December 31, 2018.  We have recognized valuation allowances to reduce these amounts to our current estimate for NOLs that will be recoverable against future taxable income prior to their expiration in accordance with the  10  appropriate tax regulations.  If our estimates change or we do not generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these NOLs we may have to record additional valuation allowances resulting in higher income tax expense.   In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entities and if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected.  In connection with such restructurings we could also incur additional charges associated with consulting fees and other charges. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We are adversely affected by regulatory uncertainties   Regulatory uncertainties regarding potential adverse changes in federal and state laws and governmental regulations materially adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.   A small number of stockholders have significant influence over us   A small number of our stockholders and members of our board of directors and management acting together would be able to exert significant influence over us through their ability to influence the election of directors and all other matters that require action by our stockholders. The voting power of these individuals could have the effect of preventing or delaying a change in control of our Company which they oppose even if our other stockholders believe it is in their best interests. Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns a substantial majority of our shares of common stock. In addition, our shareholders have authorized Gerard M. Jacobs to seek shareholders agreements and/or proxies from other parties, including potential future capital sources and the owners of potential future acquisition candidates. Accordingly, Gerard M. Jacobs has substantial influence over our policies and management. We may take actions supported by Gerard M. Jacobs that may not be viewed by some stockholders to be in our best interest, or Gerard M. Jacobs could prevent or delay a change in our control which he opposes even if our other stockholders believe it is in their best interests. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   State law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws help preserve insiders’ control over us   Provisions of Nevada state law, our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management team that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions may include: (1) authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders; (2) permitting stockholder action by written consent; and (3) establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors, or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings. These provisions, if included in our articles of incorporation or by-laws, could allow our board of directors to affect an investor’s rights as a stockholder since our board of directors could make it more difficult for preferred stockholders or common stockholders to replace members of the board of directors. Because the board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of the management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current or future management team. These factors could adversely affect our Company or the trading price of our Stock.   Retaining and attracting directors and officers may be expensive   We cannot make any assurances regarding the future roles of our current directors, Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer, and William “Jake” Jacobs, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our directors are and will in the future be involved in other businesses, and are not required to, and do not, commit their full time to our affairs, thereby causing conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our operations and the operations of other businesses. We have no employment agreements with any of our existing directors, Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer, and William “Jake” Jacobs, President and Chief Financial Officer. Some or all of our current directors, Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer, and William “Jake” Jacobs, President and Chief Financial Officer may resign upon our raising money, upon our consummation of a business combination, or otherwise. Attracting and retaining our directors and officers may be expensive, and may require that we enter into long term employment agreements, issue stock options, warrants, rights to purchase warrants, and otherwise incentivize our directors and officers. The costs of these incentives could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We indemnify our directors and officers, and certain other parties   Our bylaws specifically limit the liability of our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. As a result, aggrieved parties may have a more limited right to action than they would have had if such provisions were not present. The bylaws also provide for indemnification of our Chief Executive Officer and directors for any losses or liabilities they may incur as a result of the manner in which they operated our business or conducted internal affairs, provided that in connection with these activities they acted in good faith and in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interest. In the ordinary course of business, we also may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, independent contractors and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third-parties. We may also agree to indemnify former officers, directors, employees and independent contractors of acquired companies  11  in connection with the acquisition of such companies. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure in regard to these obligations to indemnify, due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation. Use of our capital or assets for such indemnification would reduce amounts available for the operations or for distribution to our investors, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Risk Factors Relating to Our Company and Our Securities   Our common stock may be subject to significant dilution   Our capital raising may include the sale of significant numbers of shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock, and may also include the issuance of significant numbers of options, warrants or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock. We also may issue significant numbers of shares of our common stock, or options, warrants, or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock, as a portion of the consideration for acquisitions. We are also likely to issue significant numbers of options and/or warrants, or rights to purchase warrants, to our officers, directors and/or independent contractors, and to investment bankers and finders, especially in connection with the closing of capital raises and acquisitions. Such transactions may significantly increase the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, and may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders. In addition, the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our outstanding common stock. This dilution could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, we have options, warrants, and rights to purchase warrants, outstanding covering several million shares of our common stock. If all of these millions of options and warrants were to be exercised, the number of outstanding shares of our common stock would increase significantly. Moreover, additional shares may be issued in connection with future acquisition and business operations. This dilution could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Our common stock lacks a meaningful public market   At present no active market exists for our common stock and there is no assurance that a regular trading market will develop and if developed, that it will be sustained. An owner of our common stock may, therefore, be unable to sell our common stock should he or she desire to do so. Or, if an owner of our common stock decides to sell our common stock, such sales could drive the price of our common stock significantly lower. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our common stock as pledged collateral for loans. This lack of liquidity could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Our common stock may never be listed on a national exchange   Our common stock may never meet the listing requirements of a national exchange. You should not assume that an effort to list our common stock would be successful, or if successful, that such listing requirements will be maintained, including but not limited to requirements associated with maintenance of a minimum net worth, minimum stock price, and ability to establish a sufficient number of market makers.   Our common stock may be considered a “penny stock” and may be difficult to trade   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted regulations which generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market or exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock may be less than $5.00 per share and, therefore, may be designated as a penny stock according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, to obtain a written agreement from the purchaser, and to determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may adversely affect the ability of investors to sell our common stock, and may materially adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.   Our common stock lacks institutional or analyst support   Our Company lacks institutional support. In addition, investment banks with research capabilities do not currently follow our common stock. This lack of institutional or analyst support lessens the trading volume and general market interest in our common stock, and may adversely affect an investor’s ability to trade a significant amount of our common stock. This lack of institutional or analyst support could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The public float of our common stock is small   The public float of our common stock is small, which may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our common stock. This lack of liquidity could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock. 12    The trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could drop quickly and unexpectedly   The stocks of micro-cap and small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macro-economic developments in North America and globally, and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. This volatility could materially adversely affect our Company by making it more difficult to raise capital or complete acquisitions. In addition, securities class-action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Our Company may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert our management’s attention and resources away from our business. For these reasons and others, quick and unexpected drops in the trading price of our common stock are likely from time to time. Volatility in our common stock price could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We are adversely affected by a difficult economy and by turmoil in the financial markets   Businesses are materially adversely affected by periods of significant economic slowdown or recession, fears of inflation or deflation, rising interest rates, or a public perception that any of these events are occurring or may occur, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and cash flow. In addition, as they relate to our proposed acquisitions, the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption. National and global financial and business conditions have been difficult. Access to financing has been negatively impacted. Credit is limited. In many cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers. Prominent risks include issues involving rising interest rates, trade disputes, turmoil in the Middle East and around the world, oil prices, rising health care costs, social and political unrest, and many other issues. These factors could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We may not be able to raise needed capital   We need to raise substantial amounts of additional capital both for our proposed acquisitions, to pay dividends on our preferred stock, and to cover overhead costs. In addition, our aggregate future capital requirements are uncertain. The amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors that we cannot predict with any certainty, including: the market acceptance of our products and services; the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and services and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace; our business, product, capital expenditures and technology plans, and product and technology roadmaps; technological advances; our competitors’ responses to our products and services; our pursuit of mergers and acquisitions; and our relationships with our customers.   We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the needed capital on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Delay, disruption, or failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or failure of our business plans. Our inability to raise sufficient capital on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Future sales of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.   The market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market. In addition, if our significant stockholders sell a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares, the market price of our stock could decline. Any issuance of additional common stock or common stock equivalents by us would result in dilution to our existing shareholders. Such issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount to the then-current trading price of our common stock. Moreover, the perception in the public market that stockholders may sell shares of our stock or that we may issue additional shares of common stock could depress the market for our shares and make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at any time, if at all.   We may issue additional shares of common stock without stockholder approval, which would dilute the current holders of our common stock.   Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue shares of common stock. We may issue shares of our common stock to complete a business combination or to raise capital. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount from the then-current trading price of our common stock. These issuances would dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest, which, among other things, would have the effect of reducing their influence on matters on which our stockholders vote. In addition, our stockholders and prospective investors may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options and warrants, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock.   The rights of the holders of our common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.   Our certificate of incorporation gives our Board of Directors the right to create one or more new series of preferred stock. As a  13  result, the Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and equity interests of the holders of our common stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company, which could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.   Raising capital by selling our common stock or convertible preferred stock could be expensive   If we were to raise capital by selling common stock or securities convertible into common stock, it could be expensive. We may be required to pay cash fees and/or fees in the form of warrants equal to 7% or more of the gross sales proceeds raised, in addition to legal, accounting and other fees and expenses. In addition, when it becomes known within the investment community that an issuer is seeking to raise equity capital, it is common for the common stock of that issuer to be sold off in the market, lowering the trading price of the issuer’s common stock in advance of the pricing of the issue. This could make our raising capital by selling equity securities significantly more expensive and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.   Debt financing is difficult to obtain and could be expensive   Debt financing is difficult to obtain in the current credit markets. This difficulty may make future acquisitions either unlikely, or too difficult and expensive. Providers of debt may also be issued options, warrants, or rights to purchase warrants, to purchase shares of our common stock. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Raising capital by borrowing could be risky   If we were to raise capital by borrowing to fund our operations or acquisitions, it could be risky. Cash is required to service the debt, ongoing covenants are typically employed which can restrict the way in which we operate our business, and if the debt comes due either upon maturity or an event of default, we may lack the resources at that time to either pay off or refinance the debt, or if we are able to refinance, the refinancing may be on terms that are less favorable than those originally in place, and may require additional equity or quasi-equity accommodations. These risks could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Our financing decisions may be made without stockholder approval   Our financing decisions and related decisions regarding levels of debt, capitalization, distributions, acquisitions and other key operating parameters are determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, in many cases without any notice to or vote by our stockholders. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We lack investor relations, public relations and advertising resources   We lack the resources to properly support investor relations, public relations, and advertising efforts. This puts us at a disadvantage with potential acquisition candidates, investors, research analysts, customers, and job applicants. These disadvantages could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Sales of our common stock could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall   Since the trading volume of our common stock is very low and the amount of our common stock in the public float is very small, any sales or attempts to sell our common stock, or the perception that sales or attempts to sell our common stock could occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.   An increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Stock   An increase in market interest rates may tend to make our common stock less attractive relative to other investments, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.   We do not expect to pay dividends to holders of our common stock   For the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that earnings, if any, which may be generated from our operations will be used to finance our growth and that dividends may not be paid to the holders of our common stock, which may have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Our cost of being a publicly traded company will increase significantly as our business operations expand   Our costs of being a publicly traded company currently are relatively limited. However, as we grow, our management expenses, legal and accounting fees, and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company will increase significantly. We will  14  eventually need to hire additional employees and/or additional consultants and professionals, in order to have appropriate internal financial controls and accurate financial reporting, and otherwise to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we cannot state with certainty what all of these costs will be, we believe that our management expenses, legal and accounting fees, and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company will eventually increase to at least $250,000 per year.   Risk Factors Relating to Future Acquisitions   We may not be able to identify, audit, negotiate, finance or close future acquisitions   A significant component of our growth strategy focuses on acquiring minority or majority equity ownership interests in CBD-Infused Products Companies. We may not, however, be able to identify, audit, or acquire such equity ownership interests on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, we may need to finance all or a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition by incurring indebtedness or by selling shares of our common or convertible preferred stock. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable, if at all, which will limit our ability to acquire such equity ownership interests in the future. Failure to acquire such equity ownership interests on acceptable terms, if at all, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase assets, revenues and net income and on the trading price of our common stock.   CBD-Infused Products Companies are subject to regulatory risks   CBD-Infused Products Companies are subject to risks associated with the federal government’s and state and local governments’ evolving regulation of hemp, hemp oil, CBDs, and CBD-infused products. We can provide no assurance that one or more federal agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), or state and local governments will not attempt to impose rules, regulations, moratoriums, prohibitions, or other restrictions or impediments upon CBD-Infused Products Companies. Such regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.     The US FDA considers the sale of most CBD-infused products to be illegal   The FDA appears to believe that CBDs are drugs, and that the sale of most CBD-infused products without FDA approval is illegal. In deference to the FDA’s position, various states and municipalities have similarly declared that the sale of certain CBD-infused products are illegal. There can be no guarantee or assurance whatsoever that this regulatory hostility to CBDs will be resolved favorably to the CBD products industry. Aggressive law enforcement against the CBD industry by federal, state or local authorities and agencies could have a material adverse effect upon our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    CBD-infused products may be shown to have negative health and/or safety impacts upon consumers   The health and safety impacts of CBDs have not yet been established via traditional scientific and/or clinical studies. If scientific and/or clinical studies ultimately demonstrate negative health and/or safety impacts upon consumers, our Company\\\\\\'s business and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.   Hemp and CBD-infused products are illegal if they exceed 0.3% THC   Hemp and CBD-infused products which exceed a THC concentration of 0.3% are illegal. Any failure to keep the THC concentration in hemp or CBD-infused products below 0.3% could subject us to action by regulatory authorities and/or to lawsuits by consumers, which could have a material adverse effect upon our Company\\\\\\'s business and the trading price of our common stock.    In addition, the approval of medical and recreational marijuana by many states has created a situation in which it may be difficult or impossible for regulators and courts to determine whether the THC levels reflected in consumers’ blood tests are the result of CBD-infused products or THC-infused products. This may result in regulatory actions or lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect upon our Company\\\\\\'s business and the trading price of our common stock.    Also, certain hemp products may, over time, gradually increase their THC concentration, and this may ultimately cause such products to exceed the 0.3% THC concentration level, making such products illegal in certain jurisdictions. If this happens, we could be subject to regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect upon our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The price of CBD raw materials could spike as demand for CBD-infused products increases dramatically   Although considerable additional hemp acreage is being developed around the country which is expected to increase the supply of CBD isolate, distillate and water-soluble CBD, the demand for these raw materials is also growing dramatically, and any spike in the price of these raw materials could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Target companies\\\\\\' management may not fit well into our corporate culture 15  If target companies\\\\\\' management does not fit well into our corporate culture, this could make us less attractive to potential investors, future acquisition targets may be uninterested in merging with us, and the overall chemistry among the executives in our Company could be damaged, which would materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies may rely on contract manufacturers to manufacturer their products. If the target companies are unable to maintain good relationships with their existing contract manufacturers and/or secure such contract manufacturers, their businesses could suffer   Many of the target companies’ contract manufacturers are affiliated with and manufacture other CBD-infused product brand products. In many cases, such products compete directly with the target companies’ products. If the target companies are unable to maintain good relationships with their existing contract manufacturers and/or secure such contract manufacturers, their businesses, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Large competitors are expected to enter the CBD-infused product industry   We expect that over the next few years several major beverage and other consumer products companies with tremendous financial resources will emerge to compete against our Company in the CBD-infused products industry. We may not have the personnel, products, marketing and distribution capabilities, and/or financial resources to compete effectively against such larger companies, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Regulatory risks related to alcohol and CBD   We have signed agreements to purchase up to 19.99%, and closed on the purchase of 4.99%, of CBD-infused beverage maker Ablis, and of craft distillers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits. Two of those companies produce and sell alcohol. Federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regulate how companies produce, store, transport, distribute, and sell products containing alcohol and distilled spirits. Some countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or sale of distilled spirits in whole or in part. In the United States, at the federal level, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulates the spirits and wine industry with respect to the production, blending, bottling, labeling, sales, advertising, and transportation of beverage alcohol. Similar regulatory regimes exist at the state level and in most non-U.S. jurisdictions where craft distillers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits sell their products. In addition, beverage alcohol products are subject to customs duties or excise taxation in many countries, including taxation at the federal, state, and local level in the United States. Laws of each nation define distilling and maturation requirements; for example, under U.S. federal and state regulations, bourbon and Tennessee whiskeys must be aged in new charred oak barrels. All authorizations, approvals or permits, if any, of any governmental authority or regulatory body of the United States or of any state are required in connection with the lawful selling of liquor. As 4.99%, or greater, owner of craft distillers Bendistillery and/or Bend Spirits, we are impacted by the regulatory risks relating to the production and sale of alcohol which is subject to extensive regulatory requirements regarding production, exportation, importation, marketing and promotion, labeling, distribution, pricing, and trade practices, among others. Changes in laws, regulatory measures, or governmental policies, or the manner in which current ones are interpreted, could cause the target companies to incur material additional costs or liabilities, and jeopardize the growth of their businesses in any affected market. For instance, federal, state, or local governments may prohibit, impose, or increase limitations on advertising and promotional activities, or times or locations where beverage alcohol may be sold or consumed, or adopt other measures that could limit the target companies’ opportunities to reach consumers or sell products. It is conceivable that television, newspaper, magazine, and/or internet advertising for beverage alcohol products could be limited or banned completely. Increases in regulation of this nature could substantially reduce consumer awareness of the products of the target companies in the affected markets and make the introduction of new products more challenging. The impact of increased taxation on alcohol and distilled spirits may have additional negative financial impacts on the target companies craft distillers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits.   Alcoholic beverage sales are subject to slowdowns and are seasonal   Bendistillery Inc. and Bend Spirits, Inc. are involved in the sale of a variety of distilled alcoholic beverages including vodka, whiskey and gin, and their sales of such beverages are subject to occasional slowdowns and are seasonal. Also, some health conscious consumers are reducing or eliminating their alcohol consumption entirely. These factors could adversely affect the value of our ownership interest in those companies, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    Alcoholic beverage distributors are powerful and control much of the marketplace   Bendistillery Inc. and Bend Spirits, Inc. distribute their distilled alcoholic beverages through a limited number of powerful distributors that control much of the marketplace for alcoholic beverages. The loss of such distributors, or disruptions to the operations of such distributors, could adversely affect the value of our ownership interest in those companies, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Increases in labor costs could harm the target companies\\\\\\' businesses 16  The U.S. in general, and Bend, Oregon in particular, are experiencing very low unemployment, and higher minimum wages, which generally results in rising labor costs. Such rising labor costs are adversely affecting the expenses of Bendistillery Inc. and Bend Spirits, Inc., and may adversely affect the expenses of other target companies\\\\\\' businesses, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by the FDA, state attorneys general, other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing, promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of target companies’ products   Target companies are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by the FDA, state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of their products. If an inquiry by the FDA, a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that the target companies’ products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the target companies may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of the target companies’ products, changes in their advertising, marketing and promotion practices, and/or injunctions on the sale of the products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and on the trading price of our common stock.   Litigation regarding target companies’ products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose the target companies to significant liabilities and reduce demand for their products   From time to time third parties may claim that certain statements made in the target companies’ advertisements and/or on the labels of their products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that their products are not safe. Pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for the target companies’ products, significant monetary awards against the target companies and injury to the target companies\\\\\\' reputations. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    Criticism of the target companies’ products and/or criticism or a negative perception of the target companies’ industries, could adversely affect the target companies   An unfavorable report on the health effects of the target companies’ products, including product safety concerns, could have an adverse effect on the target companies’ businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    The target companies’ inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect the target companies’ businesses and financial results   The target companies’ ability to compete in their highly competitive industries and to achieve their business growth objectives depends, in part, on their ability to develop new products and packaging. The success of their innovation, in turn, depends on their ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If they are not successful in our innovation activities, their businesses, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of the target companies’ products   The target companies’ industries are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect the target companies. The target companies’ future success will depend, in part, upon their continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative products that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand their market share, the target companies must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative products, although there can be no assurance of the target companies’ ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase the target companies’ products in the future. Product lifecycles for some brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The products the target companies currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such products will become or remain profitable for the target companies. The target companies may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. The target companies may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with customers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, the target companies may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences. If the target companies’ revenues decline, their businesses, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies’ expansion outside of the United States exposes the target companies to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 17  As some target companies’ growth strategy includes expanding internationally, if the target companies are unable to expand distribution of their products outside the United States, their growth rate could be adversely affected. In many international markets, the target companies have limited operating experience and in some areas they have no operating experience. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote their brands in international markets. Their percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the United States. The target companies face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in their international markets; unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on their ability to sell their products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. Also, their operations outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Global or regional catastrophic events could impact target companies’ operations and affect their ability to grow their businesses   Target companies’ businesses could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where their products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. Such events could impact the production and/or distribution of their products. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for their products. If they are unable to grow their businesses internationally as a result of these factors, their growth rate could decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies may rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture their products. If the target companies are unable to maintain good relationships with their bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture their products becomes constrained or unavailable to them, their businesses could suffer   The target companies may not manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource manufacturing of their finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. As a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, the target companies may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. In addition, recently there has been a consolidation of co-packers.  If the target companies are unable to maintain good relationships with their largest co-packers, or if their costs of co-packing increase, their businesses, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock. The target companies may rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute their products. If the target companies are unable to maintain good relationships with their existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, their businesses could suffer   Many of the target companies’ bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with the target companies’ products.   Unilateral decisions could be taken by the target companies’ bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying certain or all of the target companies’ products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause the target companies’ businesses to suffer.   The marketing efforts of the target companies’ distributors are important for the target companies’ success. If the target companies’ brands prove to be less attractive to the target companies’ existing bottlers and distributors, if the target companies fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or the target companies’ bottlers/distributors do not market, promote and distribute the target companies’ products effectively, their businesses, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm the target companies’ businesses   The costs and availability of the raw materials used by the target companies are subject to fluctuations. For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. The target companies do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of their products and certain of their blended concentrates, and the target companies may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Industry-wide shortages of certain flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, dairy-based products, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be,  18  encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of the target companies’ products. In addition, certain of the target companies’ co-packing arrangements may allow such co-packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost increases. The prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, may continue to rise or may rise in the future. The target companies may or may not be able to pass any of such increases on to their customers. In 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs. In addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies’ failure to accurately estimate demand for their products could adversely affect their businesses and financial results   The target companies may not correctly estimate demand for their existing products and/or new products. Their ability to estimate demand for their products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If the target companies materially underestimate demand for their products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials or experience difficulties with their co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, they might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of their products and could have a material adverse effect on their business and financial results. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   If the target companies do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if the target companies are unable to deliver their products to their customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if the target companies’ customers’ or retailers’ inventory levels are too high, the target companies’ operating results could be adversely affected   If the target companies do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, their inventory levels may be inadequate and their results of operations may be negatively impacted. If the target companies fail to meet their shipping schedules, the target companies could damage their relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase their distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver their products on a timely basis, the target companies need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of their products held by their distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact the target companies’ future sales and adversely affect their operating results. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and the target companies may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to their customers   The target companies’ packaging supply contracts may allow their suppliers to alter the costs they charge the target companies for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies. If the costs of these packaging supplies increase, the target companies may be unable to pass these costs along to their customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices they charge, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   If the target companies encounter product recalls, their businesses may suffer and they may incur material losses   The target companies may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. Material product recalls could adversely affect the target companies’ profitability and their brand images. The target companies may not maintain recall insurance. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   If the target companies are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management, there may be an adverse effect on their operations and/or their operating performance until the target companies find suitable replacements   The target companies’ businesses are dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of their senior management. The target companies may not maintain key person life insurance on any members of their senior management. The loss of services of the target companies’ senior management could adversely affect their businesses until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and the target companies may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Climate change may negatively affect the target companies’ businesses   19  There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates, and dietary and other ingredients used in the target companies’ products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt the target companies’ supply chains (including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary and other ingredients) and/or impact demand for the target companies’ products. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, may affect the target companies’ operations and the operation of the target companies’ supply chains and unfavorably impact the demand for, or the target companies’ consumers’ ability to purchase, the target companies’ products. The predicted effects of climate change may also result in challenges regarding availability and quality of water, or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact the target companies’ businesses and results of operations. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require the target companies to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on the target companies’ businesses and results of operations. Sales of the target companies’ products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which the target companies operate. Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of the target companies’ beverages, which could have an effect on the target companies’ operations, either positively or negatively. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect the target companies’ financial results   Future changes in accounting standards or practices may have an impact on the target companies’ financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way the target companies record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect the target companies’ reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages) could affect the target companies’ products’ affordability and reduce the target companies’ sales. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Fluctuations in the target companies’ effective tax rates could adversely affect their financial conditions and results of operations   The target companies may be subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, the target companies may be subjected to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. At any given time, events may occur which change the target companies’ expectations about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be variability in the target companies’ quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change the target companies’ plans for uncertain tax positions. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which imposes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and may have tax implications for the target companies. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Growth of operations will depend on the acceptance of the target companies’ products and consumer discretionary spending   The acceptance of the target companies’ products by both retailers and by consumers is critically important to their success. Shifts in retailer priorities and shifts in user preferences away from target companies’ products, target companies’ inability to develop products that appeal to both retailers and consumers, or changes in target companies’ products that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm their business. Also, their success will depend to a significant extent on discretionary user spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, target companies may experience an inability to generate revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty, when users may decide to purchase products that are cheaper or to forego purchasing any type of the target companies’ products, due to a lack of available capital. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the target companies’ sales, results of operations, business and financial condition. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.     We cannot be certain that the products that the target companies offer will become, or continue to be, appealing and as a result there may not be any demand for these products and the target companies’ sales could decrease, which would result in a loss of revenue. Additionally, there is no guarantee that interest in the target companies’ products will continue, which could adversely affect the target companies’ business and revenues   Demand for products that the target companies sell depends on many factors, including the number of customers that the target companies are able to attract and retain over time, and the competitive environments in the target companies’ industries. This may force the target companies to reduce prices below their desired pricing levels or increase promotional spending. Inability to anticipate changes in user preferences and to meet consumer’s needs in a timely and cost effective manner all could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the products the target companies plan to offer, which could adversely  20  affect the target companies’ sales, cash flows and overall financial conditions. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Competition that target companies face is varied and strong   The target companies’ products and industries are subject to competition. There is no guarantee that the target companies can develop or sustain a market position or expand their businesses. We anticipate that the intensity of competition in the future will increase.   The target companies compete with a number of entities in providing products to their customers. Such competitor entities include: (1) a variety of large multinational corporations, including but not limited to companies that have established loyal customer bases over several decades; (2) companies that have an established customer base, and have the same or a similar business plan as the target companies do and may be looking to expand nationwide; and (3) a variety of other local and national companies with which the target companies either currently or may, in the future, compete.   Many of the target companies’ current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and greater name and brand recognition than the target companies have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with both existing and potential customers. They also may be able to offer more products and more aggressively promote and sell their products. The target companies’ competitors may also be able to support more aggressive pricing than the target companies will be able to, which could adversely affect sales, cause the target companies to decrease their prices to remain competitive, or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on the target companies’ products. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies’ industries require the attraction and retention of talented employees   Success in the target companies’ industries does and will continue to require the acquisition and retention of highly talented and experienced individuals. Due to the growth in the targeted market segments, such individuals and the talent and experience they possess is in high demand. There is no guarantee that the target companies will be able to attract and maintain access to such individuals. If the target companies fail to attract, train, motivate and retain talented personnel, the target companies’ businesses, financial conditions, and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies depend on a limited number of suppliers of raw and packaging materials   The target companies rely upon a limited number of suppliers for raw and packaging materials used to make and package their products. The target companies’ success will depend in part upon their ability to successfully secure such materials from suppliers that are delivered with consistency and at a quality that meets their requirements. The price and availability of these materials are subject to market conditions. Increases in the price of the target companies’ products due to the increase in the cost of raw materials could have a negative effect on their business.   If the target companies are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw and packaging materials, delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which would have a material adverse effect on the target companies’ businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. The supply and price of raw materials used to produce the target companies’ products can be affected by a number of factors beyond the target companies’ control, such as frosts, droughts, other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growing decisions, and various plant diseases and pests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, no assurance can be given that such condition would not have a material adverse effect on the target companies’ businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, the target companies’ results of operations are dependent upon their ability to accurately forecast their requirements of raw materials. Any failure by the target companies to accurately forecast its demand for raw materials could result in an inability to meet higher than anticipated demand for products or producing excess inventory, either of which may adversely affect their results of operations. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies depend on a small number of retailers for a significant portion of their sales   Food and beverage retailers across all channels in the U.S. and other markets have been consolidating, increasing margin demands of brand suppliers, and increasing their own private brand offerings, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist target companies’ price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require target companies to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If the target companies and their distributor partners do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, the target companies’ product availability, sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers make up an important percentage of the target companies’ products’ retail volume, including volume sold by the target companies’ distributor partners. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of the target companies’ brands. The loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock. 21  The target companies depend on third party manufacturers for a portion of their businesses   A portion of the target companies’ sales revenue is dependent on third party manufacturers that the target companies do not control. The majority of these manufacturers’ business comes from producing and/or selling either their own products or their competitors’ products. As independent companies, these manufacturers make their own business decisions. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they manufacture the target companies’ products, the target companies’ competitors’ products and their own products. They may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to their brands. In most cases, they are able to terminate their manufacturing arrangements with the target companies without cause. The target companies may need to increase support for their brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them. Their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond the target companies’ control, and the target companies’ business could suffer as a result. Deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party manufacturers. Any of these factors could negatively affect the target companies’ business and financial performance. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Failure of third-party distributors upon which the target companies rely could adversely affect their businesses   The target companies rely heavily on third party distributors for the sale of their products to retailers. The loss of a significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on the target companies’ businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. The target companies’ distributors may also provide distribution services to competing brands, as well as larger, national or international brands, and may be to varying degrees influenced by their continued business relationships with other larger companies. The target companies’ independent distributors may be influenced by a large competitor if they rely on that competitor for a significant portion of their sales. There can be no assurance that the target companies’ distributors will continue to effectively market and distribute the target companies’ products. The loss of any distributor or the inability to replace a poorly performing distributor in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on the target companies’ businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the target companies will successfully attract new distributors as they increase their presence in their existing markets or expand into new markets. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Disruptions to production at the target companies’ manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur   Disruptions in production at the target companies’ manufacturing facilities could have material adverse effects on their businesses. In addition, disruptions could occur at any of the target companies’ other facilities or those of the target companies’ suppliers or distributors. The disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disaster, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation or supply interruption, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect the target companies’ business and financial performance. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies may be subject to seasonality related to sales of their products   The target companies’ businesses may be subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. The target companies’ operating results for any particular quarter may not necessarily be indicative of any other results. If for any reason the target companies’ sales were to be substantially below seasonal norms, the target companies’ annual revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations   The target companies are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of their businesses including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of their products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation and advertising of their products could damage their reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on the target companies’ beverages and their ingredients could increase in their costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of the target companies’ products, such as California’s “Prop 65,” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to the target companies’ products. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies face various operating hazards that could result in the reduction of their operations   The target companies’ operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by beverage companies that manufacture and distribute water, tea, wellness and energy drink products, such as defective products, contaminated products and damaged products. The occurrence of such problems could result in a costly product recall and serious damage to the target companies’ reputations for product quality, as well as potential lawsuits. Although the target companies sometimes may maintain insurance  22  against certain risks under various general liability and product liability insurance policies, no assurance can be given that their insurance (if any) will be adequate to fully cover any incidents of product contamination or injuries resulting from their operations and their products. The target companies may not be able to continue to maintain insurance (if any) with adequate coverage for liabilities or risks arising from their business operations on acceptable terms. Even if the insurance (if any) is adequate, insurance premiums could increase significantly which could result in higher costs for the target companies. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Litigation and publicity concerning product safety or quality, health, human and workplace rights, and other issues could damage the target companies’ brand image and corporate reputation, and may adversely affect the target companies’ results of operations, business and financial conditions   The target companies’ success depends on their ability to build and maintain the brand images for their existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain their corporate reputations. There can be no assurance that their advertising, marketing and promotional programs and their commitments to product safety and quality and human rights will have the desired impact on their products’ brand image and on consumer preference and demand. Product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Furthermore, the target companies’ brand images or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving their products or those of their competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting their industries. In addition, from time to time, there may be public policy endeavors that are either directly related to the target companies’ products and packaging or to their businesses. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts.    Similarly, the target companies’ sponsorship relationships could subject the target companies to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations or individuals the target companies sponsor or support.  Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting the target companies, or their supply chains, with human and workplace rights issues could adversely impact the target companies’ corporate images and reputations. Allegations, even if untrue, that the target companies are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by the target companies’ suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to the target companies’ products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect the target companies’ overall reputations and brand images, which in turn could have negative impacts on the target companies’ products’ acceptance by consumers.    The target companies could also incur significant liabilities, if lawsuits or claims result in decisions against them, or litigation costs, regardless of the result. Further, any litigation may cause the target companies’ key employees to expend resources and time normally devoted to the operations of their businesses. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   It is difficult and costly for target companies to protect their proprietary rights   The target companies’ commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining trademark protection, patent protection, and trade secret protection of their products and brands, as well as successfully defending that intellectual property against third-party challenges, which they might not be able to do. The target companies will only be able to protect their intellectual property related to their trademarks, patents and brands to the extent that they have rights under valid and enforceable trademarks, patents or trade secrets that cover their products and brands, which they might not have. Changes in either the trademark and patent laws or in interpretations of trademark and patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of their intellectual property (if any). Accordingly, the target companies cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in their issued trademarks or their issued patents (if any). The degree of future protection for their proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect their rights or permit them to gain or keep their competitive advantage. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in their loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages   From time to time the target companies may face intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or invalidity/non-infringement claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect the target companies negatively. For example, were a third party to succeed on an infringement claim against the target companies, the target companies may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, the target companies could face an injunction, barring them from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require the target companies to enter into a license agreement which may not be under acceptable, commercially reasonable, or practical terms or the target companies may be precluded from obtaining a license at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement  23  against the target companies may require them to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, the target companies would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require the target companies to re-validate their tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.   Finally, the target companies may initiate claims to assert or defend their own intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether the target companies are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert the target companies’ management’s attention from their businesses and negatively affect their operating results or financial condition. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The target companies may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that the target companies’ employees or the target companies have misappropriated the third parties’ intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what the target companies regard as their own intellectual property   Although the target companies try to ensure that they, their employees, and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for the target companies, they may be subject to claims that they, their employees, or independent contractors have used or disclosed intellectual property in violation of others’ rights. These claims may cover a range of matters, such as challenges to the target companies’ trademarks, as well as claims that their employees or independent contractors are using trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee’s former employer or independent contractors. As a result, the target companies may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against the target companies, to determine the ownership of what the target companies regard as their intellectual property. If the target companies fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, the target companies may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if the target companies are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We will not control businesses in which we own a minority equity ownership interest   We will not control any business in which we own a minority equity ownership interest. We can provide no assurance that the owner of the majority equity ownership interest of such business will be able to manage such business successfully. A failure by the owner to such majority equity ownership interest in such business could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    Under US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), we will not be able to consolidate our financial statements with the financial statements of companies in which we own minority equity ownership interests   Under US GAAP, we will use the cost method to account for our minority equity ownership interests in CBD-Infused Products Companies because we will own less than 20% of a target companies’ equity ownerships, and because we will have no substantial influence over the management of the CBD-Infused Products Companies. Under the cost method of accounting, we will report the historical costs of the investments as assets on our balance sheet. However, US GAAP does not permit the consolidation of our financial statements with the financial statements of companies in which we own minority equity ownership interests. As such, we will not be allowed to consolidate into our financial statements any portion of the revenues, earnings or assets of companies in which we own minority equity ownership interests. Moreover, even if there is evidence that the fair market values of the investments have increased above their historical costs, US GAAP does not allow increasing the recorded values of the investments. Under US GAAP, the only adjustments that may be made to the historical costs of the investments are write downs of the values of the investments, which must be made if there is evidence that the fair market values of the investments have declined to below the recorded historical costs. As a result of these effects of US GAAP, potential buyers of our stock may be confused because they may not be able to immediately understand the financial results and the values of the ownership interests that we have in CBD-Infused Products Companies. This situation could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    We may not be able to exit from minority equity ownership interests   We may not be able to exit from minority equity ownership interests on acceptable terms, if at all. Because our minority equity ownership interests will not allow us to control the management, operations, and direction of the businesses, a potential sale or other exit from such investment may be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve on acceptable terms, if at all. The owners of the majority equity ownership interests in such businesses may refuse to cooperate with such a sale or exit, or may engage in business practices including but not limited to inflated salaries, stock dilution, or other behavior that would result in our minority equity ownership interests having an extremely limited or non-existent market. Such a situation could materially negatively affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    We may not be able to properly brand our Company   Because we intend to acquire equity ownership interests in many different CBD-Infused Products Companies, with a range of  24  products, packaging, names and cultures, we may not be able to properly brand our Company or properly represent all of the companies in which we are invested. Consumers and potential investors may have difficulty assimilating all of our diverse business interests, and consequently may not give these equity ownership interests proper valuations. Even if we change the name of our Company to a name that more properly reflects our focus on acquiring equity ownership interests in CBD-Infused Products Companies, such a name change may not be embraced by consumers or potential investors. This situation could materially negatively affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.    We may not be able to properly manage multiple businesses   We may not be able to properly manage multiple businesses in the CBD-infused products industry. Managing multiple businesses would be more complicated than managing a single line of business, and would require that we hire and manage executives with experience and expertise in different fields. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. A failure to properly manage multiple businesses could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We may not be able to successfully integrate new acquisitions   Even if we are able to acquire additional companies or assets, we may not be able to successfully integrate those companies or assets. For example, we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with different corporate cultures, operating margins, competitive environments, computer systems, accounting software, compensation schemes, business plans and growth potential requiring significant management time and attention. In addition, the successful integration of any companies we acquire will depend in large part on the retention of personnel critical to our combined business operations due to, for example, unique technical skills or management expertise. We may be unable to retain existing management, finance, accounting, engineering, sales, customer support, and operations personnel that are critical to the success of the integrated Company, resulting in disruption of operations, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs, and otherwise diminishing anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, including loss of revenue and profitability. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Our acquisitions of businesses may be extremely risky and we could lose all of our investments   We may invest in the CBD-infused products industry or other risky industries. An investment in these companies may be extremely risky because, among other things, the companies we are likely to focus on:  (1) may be viewed as being illegal by the FDA, by state governments, or by other governmental or regulatory bodies and agencies; (2) typically have limited operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns; (3) tend to be privately-owned and generally have little publicly available information and, as a result, we may not learn all of the material information we need to know regarding these businesses; (4) are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of people; and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the operations of any business that we may acquire; (5) may have less predictable operating results; (6) may from time to time be parties to litigation; (7) may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence; (8) may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position; and (9) their financial statements may be unaudited, improperly prepared, and/or their internal financial controls may be inadequate or non-existent. Our failure to make acquisitions efficiently and profitably could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.   Future acquisitions may fail to perform as expected   Future acquisitions may fail to perform as expected. The acquisitions may be unaudited and we may be supplied inaccurate or misleading historical financial results. Also, non-financial information supplied to us regarding the acquisitions may be inaccurate or misleading. We may overestimate cash flow, underestimate costs, or fail to understand risks. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Competition may result in overpaying for acquisitions   Other investors with significant capital may compete with us for attractive investment opportunities. These competitors may include publicly traded companies, private equity firms, privately held buyers, individual investors, and other types of investors. Such competition may increase the price of acquisitions, or otherwise adversely affect the terms and conditions of acquisitions. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We may have insufficient resources to cover our operating expenses, dividends owed on our preferred stock, and the expenses of raising money and consummating acquisitions   We have limited cash to cover our operating expenses, dividends owed on our preferred stock, and the expenses incurred in connection with money raising and a business combination. It is possible that we could incur substantial costs in connection with  25  money raising or a business combination. If we do not have sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain additional financing, either from our management or third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and neither our management nor any third party is obligated to provide any financing. This could have a negative impact on our Company and our common stock price.   The nature of our proposed future operations is speculative and will depend to a great extent on the businesses which we acquire   While management currently is exclusively exploring potential acquisitions of CBD-Infused Products Companies, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in locating an acquisition candidate meeting our criteria. In the event we complete a merger or acquisition transaction, of which there can be no assurance, our success, if any, will be dependent upon the operations, financial condition and management of the target company, and upon numerous other factors beyond our control. If the operations, financial condition or management of the target company were to be disrupted or otherwise negatively impacted following a transaction, our Company and our common stock price would be negatively impacted.   We may carry out actions that will not require our stockholders’ approval   The terms and conditions of any acquisition could require us to take actions that would not require our stockholders’ approval. In order to acquire certain companies or assets, we may issue additional shares of common or convertible preferred stock, borrow money or issue debt instruments including debt convertible into capital stock. Not all of these actions would require our stockholders’ approval even if these actions dilute our stockholders’ economic or voting interests as shareholders.   Our investigation of potential acquisitions will be limited   Our analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our Investment Committee. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities and ventures, we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by our Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities or ventures by conducting a “due diligence investigation”. In a due diligence investigation, we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target companies’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our Investment Committee to personally meet with management and key personnel of target companies, ask questions regarding the target companies’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target companies to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise. Any failure of our typical due diligence investigation to uncover issues and problems relating to target companies could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We will have only a limited ability to evaluate the directors and management of potential acquisitions   We may make a determination that our current directors and Chief Executive Officer should not remain, or should reduce their roles, following money raising or a business combination, based on an assessment of the experience and skill sets of new directors and officers and the management of target companies. We cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We will be dependent on outside advisors to assist us   In order to supplement the business experience of management, we may employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, independent contractors or other consultants or advisors. The selection of any such advisors will be made by management and without any control from shareholders. Additionally, it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged by us on an independent basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. This could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   We may fail to manage our growth effectively   Future growth through acquisitions and organic expansion would place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical, training, systems and financial resources. We can give you no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations properly or cost effectively. A failure to properly and cost-effectively manage our expansion could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   The management of companies we acquire may lose their enthusiasm or entrepreneurship after the sale of their businesses   We can give no assurance that the management of future companies we acquire will have the same level of enthusiasm for operating their businesses following their acquisition by us; or, if they cease performing services for the acquired businesses, that we will be able to install replacement management with the same skill sets and determination. There also is always a risk that  26  management of companies we acquire will attempt to reenter the market and possibly seek to recruit some of our  employees. This could materially adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.   If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination   We believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act (the “Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. However, in the event that we engage in business combinations which result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Act. In such event, we may be required to register as an investment company and may incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the government as to our status under the Act, and consequently, any violation of such Act might subject us to material adverse consequences.   Risk Factors Relating to Accounting and Internal Financial Controls   We do not currently employ a full time chief executive officer or a full time chief financial officer   Our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are part-time employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to retain full-time officers and compensate them at a level acceptable to us. This could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   New accounting standards could adversely impact us   From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory bodies may issue new and revised standards, interpretations and other guidance that change Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The effects of such changes may include prescribing an accounting method where none had been previously specified, prescribing a single acceptable method of accounting from among several acceptable methods that currently exist, or revoking the acceptability of a current method and replacing it with an entirely different method, among others. Such changes to GAAP could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and other financial measures. Such changes could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   Decreased effectiveness of stock options could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees   We expect to use stock options, warrants, and/or rights to purchase warrants to purchase common stocks as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention, and to provide competitive compensation packages. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our common stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees or to attract additional highly-qualified personnel. At any given time, a portion of our outstanding employee stock options, warrants, and/or rights to purchase warrants, to purchase common stock may have exercise prices in excess of our then-current common stock price, or may have expired worthless. To the extent these circumstances occur, our ability to retain employees may be adversely affected. As a result, we may have to incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy, or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees. Any of these situations could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.   USE OF PROCEEDS   This prospectus relates to Shares that may be offered and sold from time to time by the Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds upon the sale of Shares by the Selling Stockholders in this offering.    DIVIDEND POLICY   We have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and currently intend to retain all of our cash and any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.   DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE   The Selling Stockholders will determine at what price they may sell the offered Shares (if any), and such sales may be made at prevailing market prices, or at privately negotiated prices.   THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT   On May 13, 2019, we closed a private placement offering of 66,150 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock by entering  27  into Stock Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with a group of 26 unaffiliated accredited investors and Thomas W. Hines, who became a member of our Board of Directors on February 27, 2019 (the “May 13, 2019 Private Placement”). Each share of Preferred Stock sold to investors was sold at a per unit price of $100. The shares of Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of newly issued common stock of the Company, at $1.00 per share of common stock of the Company which is 100 common stock shares per share of Preferred A Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock pays dividends at the rate of 3% annually. The Series A Preferred Stock dividends are cumulative if the Company does not have the necessary cash to pay the dividend when due. The Series A Preferred Stock dividends shall cease to accrue at such time as the Company’s Common Stock has closed at $3.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days after the first date that the registration statement is effective, and there have been, on average, at least 25,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days. The Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have voluntary conversion rights. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock are subject to Mandatory Conversion (in the discretion of the Company) at such time as the Company’s Common Stock has closed at $5.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days after the first date that the registration statement is effective, and there have been, on average, at least 50,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days.   The investors in the May 13, 2019 Private Placement purchased a total 66,150 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.   To facilitate the transaction, we paid brokers’ fees in regard to the capital being raised for the Company by such brokers in the May 13, 2019 Private Placement of Preferred Stock. The fees consisted of warrants to purchase 396,900 unregistered shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1 per share, exercisable at any time during a five year period. There were no cash fees paid. SELLING STOCKHOLDERS   This prospectus covers the possible resale by the Selling Stockholders identified below, or its transferee(s), of a total of 6,615,000 shares of common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible. The Selling Stockholders may, from time to time, offer and sell pursuant to this prospectus any or all of the Shares that we have sold to them. The Selling Stockholders may sell some, all or none of their Shares.

The Selling Stockholders may be deemed “underwriters,” within the meaning of the Securities Act.   The Selling Stockholders, or their pledges, donees, transferees, or any of its successors in interest selling Shares received from the Selling Stockholders as a gift, partnership distribution or other non-sale related transfer after the date of this prospectus, may sell all or a portion of the Shares beneficially owned by them and offered hereby from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the shares of Common Stock are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the Selling Stockholders will be responsible for underwriting discounts or commissions or agent\\\\\\'s commissions. The Shares may be sold in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. The Selling Stockholders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve crosses or block transactions:   29  \\uf0b7on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale;  \\uf0b7in the over-the-counter market;  \\uf0b7in transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market;  \\uf0b7through the writing of options, whether such options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise;  \\uf0b7ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  \\uf0b7block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  \\uf0b7purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  \\uf0b7an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  \\uf0b7privately negotiated transactions;  \\uf0b7short sales;  \\uf0b7through the distribution of the common stock by any Selling Stockholders to their partners, members or stockholders;  \\uf0b7through one or more underwritten offerings on a firm commitment or best efforts basis;  \\uf0b7sales pursuant to Rule 144;  \\uf0b7broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  \\uf0b7a combination of any such methods of sale; and  \\uf0b7any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.    The Selling Stockholders may also transfer the Shares by gift. The Selling Stockholders may engage brokers and dealers, and any brokers or dealers may arrange for other brokers or dealers to participate in effecting sales of the Shares. These brokers, dealers or underwriters may act as principals, or as an agent of a Selling Stockholders. Broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of the Shares at a stipulated price per security. If the broker-dealer is unable to sell the Shares acting as agent for the Selling Stockholders, it may purchase as principal any unsold Shares at the stipulated price. Broker-dealers who acquire Shares as principals may thereafter resell the Shares from time to time in transactions in any stock exchange or automated interdealer quotation system on which the Shares are then listed, at prices and on terms then prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the then-current market price or in negotiated transactions. Broker-dealers may use block transactions and sales to and through broker-dealers, including transactions of the nature described above.   The Selling Stockholders may also sell the Shares in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, rather than pursuant to this prospectus, regardless of whether the Shares are covered by this prospectus.   If the Selling Stockholders effects such transactions by selling Shares to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the Selling Stockholders or commissions from purchasers of the shares of common stock for whom they may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal (which discounts, concessions or commissions as to particular underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may be in excess of those customary in the types of transactions involved). In connection with sales of the Shares or otherwise, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the Shares in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell Shares short and deliver Shares covered by this prospectus to close out short positions and to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales. The Selling Stockholders may also loan or pledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such shares.   The Selling Stockholders may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the Shares owned by them and, if they default in the performance of its secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the Shares from time to time pursuant to this prospectus or any amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending, if necessary, the list of Selling Stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as Selling Stockholders under this prospectus. The Selling Stockholders also may transfer and donate the Shares in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.   In addition, the Selling Stockholders may, from time to time, sell the Shares short, and, in those instances, this prospectus may be delivered in connection with the short sales and the Shares offered under this prospectus may be used to cover short sales.   The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealer participating in the distribution of the Shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any commission paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. At the time a particular offering of the Shares is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed which will set forth the aggregate amount of Shares being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the Selling Stockholders and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to broker-dealers. The Selling Stockholders may indemnify any broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving the sale of the Shares against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.   30  Under the securities laws of some states, the Shares may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the Shares may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with.   There can be no assurance that the Selling Stockholders will sell any or all of the Shares registered pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.   The Selling Stockholders and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of common stock by the Selling Stockholders and any other participating person. Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the Shares to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the Shares and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the Shares.   We will pay all expenses of the registration of the Shares which is estimated to be $30,000 in total. Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the Shares will be freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this prospectus.    Basis of Presentation   Our Company has a history of recurring losses, which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of $14,005,689 as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, our Company has no sources of revenue. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   This MD&A section discusses our Company’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition and certain factors that may affect our future results. You should read this MD&A in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report.   Overview   Acquired Sales Corp. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Acquired Sales”, the “Company”, “AQSP”, “Acquired”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986.    The Company wants to acquire all or a portion of one or more operating businesses.    Management of the Company currently is exclusively exploring potential acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products such as beverages, muscle/joint rubs, oils, crystals, tinctures, bath bombs, isolate, relief balms, elixirs, body washes, med sticks, lotions, vape pens and cartridges, shatter, and gummies (a “CBD-Infused Products Company”).    In order to consummate a particular acquisition of a CBD-Infused Products Company, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are related to such CBD-Infused Products Company, for example operating businesses and/or assets involving distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, paraphernalia, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-infused products, and real estate.    Execution of Stock Purchase Agreement  to Purchase up to 19.99% of CBD-Infused Beverage Maker Ablis, and of Craft Distillers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits   On April 30, 2019, the Company signed stock purchase agreements to purchase up to 19.99% of the common stock of CBD-infused beverage maker Ablis (formerly Ablis LLC) (www.AblisBev.com), and of craft distillers Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits (www.CraterLakeSpirits.com) and Bend Spirits, Inc. (www.Bendistillery.com), Bend, Oregon, for a total of $7,596,200 in cash.   Founded in 1996, Bendistillery is America\\\\\\'s most award winning craft distillery, with an outstanding reputation for producing Crater Lake Spirits brands including vodkas, gins, whiskeys, and white label brands offered through Bend Spirits.  31  Ablis is a rapidly growing leader in the exciting CBD-infused beverage industry. Ablis\\\\\\' all-natural, shelf-stable, GMO-free, non-alcoholic, lemon ginger, cranberry blood orange, and 0 calorie lemon water beverages target the mainstream health market and contain no THC. Ablis also manufactures and sells CBD-infused rubs, oils and crystals. Ablis\\\\\\' beverages are now being distributed in 11 states, online throughout the country, Puerto Rico and Guam. Also, Ablis has recently received state approval to co-brand with a local brewery in Bend to produce Oregon\\\\\\'s first hemp CBD-infused draft beer.    Closing of the purchase is subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of mutually acceptable due diligence, completion of a capital raise, execution of definitive documentation, obtaining necessary third party approvals, and completion of all necessary securities filings.   Pursuant to such stock purchase agreements, on April 30, 2019, the we closed on a first tranche purchase of 4.99% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits for an aggregate purchase price of $1,896,200.    We have the right to purchase up to an additional 15% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits under the stock purchase agreements through July 31, 2019, but doing so will only be possible if the Company closes on the sale of additional preferred stock or otherwise raises capital, and receives approval to do so from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, among other conditions.    The management teams of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits are continuing to lead their respective companies following the closing of our purchase of 4.99% of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits. Gerard M. Jacobs, CEO of the Company, has joined the board of directors of each of the companies, and William C. Jacobs, President and CFO of the Company, will be paid quarterly by the companies in regard to financial oversight of the companies.

At December 31, 2017, we had total current assets of $0.    Current liabilities at December 31, 2018 of $338,622 primarily consisted of accounts payable to related parties of $193,000 and trade accounts payable of $113,450. Accounts payable to related parties consisted mainly of liabilities for independent contractor fees payable to William C.

Jacobs, our Chief Executive Officer, made a non-interest bearing loan of $4,000 to the Company, which is payable upon demand. The $4,000 note payable to the company affiliated with Gerard M. Jacobs was still outstanding at December 31, 2018.      The Company had an accumulated deficit of $14,005,689 and $13,785,068 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   Comparison of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017   The Company did not generate revenue from continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.    Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of independent contractor fees, travel expenses, phone, internet and hotspot expense, meals and entertainment, and other less material accounts. Selling, general and administrative expenses were  32  $71,299 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $65,021 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6,278.

The Company is currently negotiating regarding certain potential investment opportunities, but there can be no assurance at this time that any investments will come to fruition and that the Company will have future operating income. The Company has a history of losses as evidenced by the accumulated deficit at December 31, 2018 of $14,005,689.   Critical Accounting Policies   Critical accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements accompanying this prospectus.    The William Noyes Webster Foundation, Inc.   The William Noyes Webster Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”), a non-profit Massachusetts corporation, has received a provisional registration from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to own and operate a medical marijuana cultivation facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and a medical marijuana dispensary in Dennis, Massachusetts. Heatley is the founder and a member of the board of directors of the Foundation.   Teaming Agreement – We believe it is highly likely that the board of directors of the Foundation will only approve contracts that have been negotiated and approved by Heatley. Consequently, on July 8, 2014, we entered into a Teaming Agreement (the \"Teaming Agreement\") with Heatley, in which, among other things: (1) we and Heatley agreed to use our respective best efforts, working exclusively together as a team, and not as a partnership or other entity, in order to consummate transactions, agreements, contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we will provide capital and expertise to the Foundation; and (2) Heatley agreed that Heatley shall not, and shall not permit the Foundation to, discuss or negotiate for debt or equity financing, or consulting services or other expertise, from any third party. We claim that Heatley violated the Teaming Agreement by discussing and negotiating for debt or equity financing, or consulting services or other expertise, from at least one third party. Heatley claims that we violated the Teaming Agreement alleging that we failed to lend funds to the Foundation in accordance with the Teaming Agreement. We believe Heatley\\\\\\'s claim to be baseless. No assurances whatsoever can be made that Heatley will comply with the terms of the Teaming Agreement, nor that we will be able to adequately enforce the terms of the Teaming Agreement if it is ever the subject of litigation.   Promissory Note – On July 14, 2014, the Foundation signed and delivered to us a Secured Promissory Note (the \"Note\") which is in the stated loan amount of $1,500,000, and is secured by a Security Agreement of even date therewith (the “Security Agreement”). The Note provides that the $1,500,000 loan may be advanced in one or more installments as the Foundation and we may mutually agree upon. The Foundation and we mutually agreed that the first installment of this loan would be $602,500. Pursuant to instructions from the Foundation, on July 14, 2014, we paid $2,500 owed by the Foundation to one of its consultants, and we advanced $600,000 directly to the Foundation. The amount and timing of subsequent loan installments under the Note, which could have totaled $897,500, had not yet been mutually agreed upon between the Foundation and us as of the date of the Note.    Between April and July 2015, we loaned an additional $135,350 to the Foundation, evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Agreement. Following such additional loans, the principal of the loan from us to the Foundation, evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Agreement, is now $737,850.   The principal balance outstanding under the Note bore interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum, compounded monthly. It was contemplated that the first payment of accrued interest by the Foundation under the Note would be made as soon after the  33  Foundation commences operations of the Plymouth Cultivation Facility and the Dennis Dispensary as the Foundation\\\\\\'s cash flows shall reasonably permit, but in any event no later than one year after the Foundation commences operations. The principal of the Note would be payable in eight consecutive equal quarterly installments, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Foundation commences operations. Principal on the Note and related accrued interest would be considered past due if the aforementioned payments were not received by their due dates.   Uncollectable Note and Interest Receivable – We assessed the collectability of the Note based on the adequacy of the Foundation’s collateral and the Foundation’s capability of repaying the Note according to its terms. Based on this assessment, on September 1, 2015, we concluded that Note and interest receivable would not be collectible. As such, we wrote off the Note totaling $737,850 and interest receivable totaling $97,427 as bad debt expense on September 1, 2015.   Acquisition of Real Estate in Rhode Island    As discussed in our prior public filings, we have attempted to acquire one or more of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties. The Mesolella/Jacobs Properties are parcels of real estate in Rhode Island that are owned by entities affiliated with Vincent J. Mesolella and his son Derek V. Mesolella, formerly one of our independent contractors. One of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties is also partly owned by an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs.   Discussions among Messrs. Mesolella and Jacobs and our independent directors have made it highly likely that we will never purchase any of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties.   Simultaneous with Vincent J. Mesolella’s agreement to negotiate in good faith regarding the possibility of us acquiring the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties, in November 2014, the officers and directors of the Company were awarded the right to purchase, directly or using a designee, for an aggregate price of $2 per director: (a) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.35 million shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.01 per share; and (b) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.35 million shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.85 per share, 100,000 of which warrants are vested, and 1.25 million of which warrants are subject to the condition that the Company shall have acquired at least one of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties.      Other Matters   We may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We intend to defend vigorously against any such claims. Although the outcome of these other matters is currently not determinable, our management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   BUSINESS   Business Overview   For the past many years, our stated objective has been to acquire all or a portion of one or more operating businesses. In the past year, we have been exploring potential acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products such as beverages, muscle/joint rubs, oils, crystals, tinctures, bath bombs, isolate, relief balms, elixirs, body washes, med sticks, lotions, vape pens and cartridges, shatter, and gummies (a “CBD-Infused Products Company”). In order to consummate a particular acquisition of a CBD-Infused Products Company, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are related to such CBD-Infused Products Company, for example operating businesses and/or assets involving distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, paraphernalia, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-infused products, and real estate. We have entered into agreements with a number of operating business to acquire some or all of the businesses.

The Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement also sets out terms for an additional equity purchase of Ablis HC such that the Company may purchase up to an additional 15% of Ablis HC for $1,200,000 so that the Company would then own 19.99% of the ownership equity of Ablis HC.

The consideration to be paid by us in the proposed purchase of Lion is (i) cash in the amount of $2,000,000; (ii) equity in the amount of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock; and, (iii) debt payments totaling $462,430 of Lion’s debts owed to its current affiliates.

In the event that the proposed acquisition of Lion is completed, the Letter of Intent requires that as soon as practicable following the closing of the proposed sale, we will change our name to \"CBD Lion Corp.” and request a new trading symbol that better relates to the new proposed name.   Letter of Intent – Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids   On May 23, 2019, we entered into a Letter of Intent with Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids (“Lifted”), and its owner Nicholas S.

The letter of intent contains customary provisions prohibiting Lifted from soliciting or encouraging any other acquisition proposal or entering into any negotiations or agreements for an alternative acquisition transaction prior to the termination of the Letter of Intent.   In the event that the proposed acquisition of Lifted is completed, the Letter of Intent requires that Lifted shall operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBD Lion Corp. under the Lifted brand, led by Nicholas S. Warrender as Lifted’s CEO.    The terms of the proposed CBD Lion and Lifted Liquids transactions must be set forth in definitive agreements. There are no assurances that we will be successful in negotiating acceptable definitive agreements, when or whether definitive agreements will be reached between the parties, or that the proposed purchases will be consummated. Even if definitive agreements are executed, the terms of the proposed purchases may change materially from the terms set forth in the letters of intent. There will be many conditions to closing, many of which are outside of the parties’ control and we cannot predict whether these conditions will be satisfied. There are no assurances when or if closings will occur, even if the parties successfully negotiate and sign definitive agreements.   Future Acquisitions   An Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors, currently consisting of our CEO Gerard M. Jacobs, director Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA, and our President and CFO William C. Jacobs, CPA, will review material furnished to it and will ultimately decide if a transaction is in our best interests and the interests of our shareholders. We intend to source acquisition opportunities through our Chief Executive Officer and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include the shareholders of Ablis, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities may become available to us due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) Our ownership of shares in one or more CBD-Infused Products Companies; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity. 36    The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of an Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities, we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by such Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.   In a due diligence investigation, we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our Investment Committee to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding the target businesses’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target businesses to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.   There is no guarantee that we can obtain or maintain the funding needed for our operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services.   As of July 26, 2019, we have cash on hand of $4,721,147. In prior years, our payables have been greater than our cash on hand. We have inconsistent income generating ability and are therefore reliant on raising money from loans or stock sales.   Properties   Acquired Sales Corp. is currently provided rent-free office space by our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, at 31 N. Suffolk Lane, Lake Forest, Illinois 60045. Acquired Sales Corp. pays the phone, facsimile, internet, travel and other business expenses of our Chief Executive Officer Gerard M. Jacobs and of our President and Chief Financial Officer, William C. Jacobs, CPA, who is the son of Gerard M. Jacobs.   Employees   Our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, runs our operations on a part-time basis and is compensated with equity; see the section entitled “Executive Compensation”. Mr. Gerard M. Jacobs has not historically received cash compensation, but has begun to receive a consulting fee of $7,500 per month and is expected to receive cash salary and bonuses in the future, pursuant to a compensation agreement entered into between the Company, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs in June 2019 (the “Compensation Agreement”). Our President and Chief Financial Officer, William C. Jacobs, CPA, who is the son of our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, handles our financial matters on a part-time basis and is currently compensated at the rate of $5,000 per month, but, like Gerard M. Jacobs, is expected to receive a larger cash salary and bonuses in the future pursuant to the Compensation Agreement. Both Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs are entitled to reimbursement for all of their business-related expenses. We currently have no full-time employees.    In the future, we plan to engage full-time employees, including Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs under employment agreements, with full-time salaries, bonuses and benefits appropriate to the nature and scope of our future business operations. We expect to continue to use consultants, attorneys, accountants and independent contractors as necessary. Such consultants may include director Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA, who is a member of our Investment Committee.   Legal Proceedings   From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.   Corporate Information   We were organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986 as Cornerstone Capital Corporation. In July 1992, the Company changed its name to GS International Technologies and then to Protective Technologies International Marketing in November 1996 to reflect business development efforts at that time.    1999 Change In Control and Name-Armed Alert Security   The Company reorganized its debt, equity and management in 1999. In June 1999, the Company acquired Armed Alert Security, a commercial and residential security products and services to individuals, families, and businesses. The owners of Armed Alert Security were issued shares in connection with the acquisition of Armed Alert Security by the Company giving them control over the Company. In connection with the acquisition of Armed Alert Security, the Company changed its name on July 3, 1999 to better reflect its business. In addition, the Company completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split on June 4, 1999. 37    In August 2001, we ceased all of our prior operations and remained dormant from then until May 27, 2004 when we began development stage activities.    2006-2007 Change In Control and Name-Acquired Sales Corp.   Commencing in 2006, we entered into activities to propose to seek, investigate and, if warranted, acquire an interest in one or more businesses. In connection with these changes, we changed our name to Acquired Sales Corp. As a part of this restructuring, the Company completed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split on March 1, 2006. On July 26, 2007, control of the stock of the company was transferred to Gerard M. Jacobs and control of the management was changed to Gerard M. Jacobs as well, with the appointment of 6 new officers and directors and the resignation of L. Dee Hall, the sole officer and director as of that time.    MANAGEMENT   Executive Officers and Directors   The following table sets forth certain information regarding our current Directors and Executive Officers as of July 26, 2019.    Name Age Position  Joshua A. Bloom, M.D. 63 Director  Gerard M. Jacobs 64 Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary  James S. Jacobs, M.D. 65 Director  William C. \"Jake\" Jacobs, CPA 31 President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer  Michael D. McCaffrey 73 Director  Vincent J. Mesolella 70 Director  Richard E. Morrissy 64 Director  Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA 60 Director     Our Directors serve in such capacity until the next annual meeting of our shareholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Our Chief Executive Officer serves at the discretion of our Board of Directors, until his death, or until he resigns or has been removed from office.   Joshua A. Bloom, M.D., age 63, has been a member of our board of directors since July 2007. He has been a practicing physician in Kenosha, Wisconsin since completion of his training in 1988. He is board Certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Diseases, Critical Care Medicine and in Hospice and Palliative Care. He has been employed by Froedtert South (formerly known as United Hospital System) in the Clinical Practice Division from 1995 to present. He had been in private practice at the same address from 1988 to 1995. Dr. Bloom served on the board of directors of Kenosha Health Services Corporation from 1993 to approximately 2010 and the board of Hospice Alliance, Inc. since 1994 and Medical Director there since 1998. He also served on the board of the Beth Israel Sinai Congregation 1998 to 2014, where he served as the President from 2004 until 2010. We believe that Dr. Bloom’s experience serving as a director of the Corporation since 2007, his intelligence and educational background, and his familiarity with the medical field which has in the past and is currently providing candidates for potential acquisitions by the Corporation, qualifies him to serve as a director of the Corporation.   Dr. Bloom received a medical degree from the University of Illinois in 1982 and completed his residency in internal medicine in 1985 and fellowship in Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine in 1988; both at the University of Illinois. He received an MS in Organic Chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1978 and a BS in Chemistry from Yale College in 1977.   Gerard M. Jacobs, age 64, is Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company. Mr. Jacobs has been a private investor since 2006. In 2001, Mr. Jacobs took control of CGI Holding Corporation, and served as its Chief Executive Officer and member of its board of directors until 2006. Under Mr. Jacobs’ guidance, CGI Holding Corporation changed its name to Think Partnership Inc., made 15 acquisitions primarily of businesses involved in online marketing and advertising, and succeeded in having its common stock listed on the American Stock Exchange. The company is now known as Inuvo Inc. (NYSE:MKT: INUV). Previously, in 1995, Mr. Jacobs took control of General Parametrics Corporation, and served as its Chief Executive Officer and member of its board of directors until 1999. Under Mr. Jacobs’ guidance, General Parametrics changed its name to Metal Management Inc., made 37 acquisitions primarily of businesses involved in scrap metal recycling, and succeeded in building one of the largest scrap metal recycling companies in the world. The company is now part of Sims Metal Management Ltd. (ASX trading symbol: SGM). Mr. Jacobs has also served as the lead outside director for America’s Car-Mart, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRMT) and Patient Home Monitoring Corp. (Toronto: PHM). We believe that Mr. Jacobs’ experience serving as the Chief Executive Officer of three publicly traded companies and as a director of two other publicly traded companies, his work as an investment banker and as an attorney, and his intelligence and educational background, qualifies him to serve as a director of the Corporation. 38  Mr. Jacobs received a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School, which he attended as a Weymouth Kirkland Law Scholar, in 1978; and an A.B from Harvard College, in 1976, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Mr. Jacobs’ brother, James S. Jacobs, M.D., is also a member of our board of directors.   James S. Jacobs, M.D., age 65, has been a member of our board of directors since July 2007. He is a Physician in the Department of Radiation Oncology, at St. Joseph Hospital in Denver, Colorado. He was previously the Resident Physician in Radiation Oncology at Rush Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. We believe that Dr. Jacobs’ experience serving as a director of the Corporation since 2007, his intelligence and educational background, and his familiarity with the medical field which has in the past and is currently providing candidates for potential acquisitions by the Corporation, qualifies him to serve as a director of the Corporation.   Dr. Jacobs did a residency in Radiation Oncology at Rush Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois and an internal medicine internship and residency at the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver, Colorado. Dr. Jacobs received a BA in Neuroscience from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1976.   William C. “Jake” Jacobs, CPA, age 31, is President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company. Effective as of February 27, 2019, the Board appointed Mr. Jacobs, the son of our Company’s Chief Executive Officer Gerard M. Jacobs, to serve as the President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company. Prior to becoming President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company, Mr. Jacobs served as an independent contractor for the Company for the past several years. Previously, Mr. Jacobs worked in the Assurance Division of Ernst & Young (doing business as EY), auditing both publicly traded and privately held companies. Mr. Jacobs graduated from the University of Southern California, with a double major in Accounting and Finance. In 2015, Mr. Jacobs won a Gold Medal at the United States of America Snowboard and Freeski Association (USASA) National Championships in the BoarderCross Snowboard Senior (23-29) Men’s division.   William C. Jacobs will earn compensation from the Company at the rate of $5,000 per month. He is also entitled to reimbursement for all of his business-related expenses. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company owes Mr. Jacobs $175,000 for unpaid independent contractor fees that have been accruing since 2016.   Michael D. McCaffrey, age 73, has been a member of our board of directors since July 2007. He is an attorney practicing in Irvine, California and specializing in commercial and business litigation. Mr. McCaffrey has tried more than 100 jury and non-jury trials, representing numerous large companies, institutional lenders, real estate developers, contractors and various public and private corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships.

We believe that Michael D. McCaffrey’s experience serving as a litigator and advisor to corporations, and his intelligence and educational background, qualifies him to serve as a director of the Corporation.   Mr. McCaffrey received his Juris Doctor in 1974 from the University of Denver College of Law where he was a member of the University of Denver Law Review (qualified by class rank, top 5%) and received a B.S. in Engineering from UCLA in 1968.

Mr. Mesolella has served on the board of directors of Think Partnership Inc., an American Stock Exchange company. Mr. Mesolella has raised a great deal of money for charities including the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Mr. Mesolella resides in Rhode Island. We believe that Vincent J. Mesolella’s experience serving as a director of two publicly traded companies including service as Chairman of the Audit Committee of both, his work as a developer and business owner, his experience as an elected public official, his Chairmanship of a major wastewater treatment organization that has been nationally recognized for its excellence, his intelligence and educational background, and his familiarity with the real estate industry which has in the past and is currently providing candidates for potential acquisitions by the Corporation, qualifies him to serve as a director of the Corporation.

During his tenure, Mr. Morrissy managed clinical research trials including the submission of institutional review board documents and grant proposals, recruitment of subjects and data management and storage. He also designed and led  39  focus groups, designed and critiqued research surveys, and edited manuscripts and scientific journals. We believe that Mr. Morrissy’s experience serving as a director of the Corporation since 2007, his intelligence and educational background, and his familiarity with the medical field which has in the past and is currently providing candidates for potential acquisitions by the Corporation, qualifies him to serve as a director of the Corporation.

Jacobs, M.D. are brothers. There are no other family relationships among any of our officers or directors. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE   Our Board of Directors   Our Board of Directors is currently composed of seven members: Messrs. Gerard M. Jacobs, Joshua A. Bloom, M.D., Thomas W. Hines, James S. Jacobs, M.D., Michael D. McCaffrey, Richard E. Morrissy and Vincent J. Mesolella. Our Board has decided that it would judge the independence of its directors by the heightened standards established by the NASDAQ Stock Market, despite the Company not being subject to these standards at this time. Accordingly, the Board has determined that five of our six non-employee directors, Messrs. Joshua A. Bloom, M.D., Thomas W. Hines, Michael D. McCaffrey, Richard E. Morrissy and Vincent J. Mesolella, each meet the independence standards established by the NASDAQ Stock Market and the applicable independence rules and regulations of the SEC, including the rules relating to the independence of the members of our audit committee and compensation committee. Our Board of Directors considers a director to be independent when the director is not an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, does not have any relationship which would, or could reasonably appear to, materially interfere with the independent judgment of such director, and the director otherwise meets the independence requirements under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the rules and regulations of the SEC.   Board Committees   Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert   We have an audit committee consisting of Joshua A. Bloom, M.D., Thomas W. Hines, Michael D. McCaffrey, Vincent J. Mesolella and Richard E. Morrissy as members. We have not adopted an Audit Committee charter. Vincent J. Mesolella serves as our audit committee chairman and financial expert. Our audit committee performs the following functions including: (1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of its members is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial business experience that results in that member’s financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that each of its members has the sufficient knowledge and experience necessary to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee member should have for a business such as the Company.   Compensation Committee   Our compensation committee is comprised of Messrs. Bloom, Hines, McCaffrey, Mesolella and Morrissy. Joshua A. Bloom, M.D. is Chairman of the compensation committee. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and recommending to our Board of Directors the annual salary, bonus, stock compensation and other benefits of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer; reviewing and providing recommendations regarding compensation and bonus levels of other members of senior management; reviewing and making recommendations to our Board of Directors on all new executive compensation programs; reviewing the compensation of our Board of Directors; and administering our equity incentive plans. The compensation committee may delegate any or all of its duties or responsibilities to a subcommittee of the compensation committee, to the extent consistent with the Company\\\\\\'s organizational documents and all applicable laws,  40  regulations and rules of markets in which our securities trade, as applicable. The Board has determined that each member of the compensation committee is “independent,” as that term is defined by the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.   Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee   Our corporate governance and nominating committee is comprised of Messrs. Bloom, Hines, McCaffrey, Mesolella and Morrissy. Michael D. McCaffrey is Chairman of the corporate governance and nominating committee. The corporate governance and nominating committee is responsible for, among other things, annually assessing the composition, skills, size and tenure of the Board of Directors in advance of annual meetings and whenever individual directors indicate that their status may change; annually considering new members for nomination to the Board of Directors; causing the Board of Directors to annually review the independence of directors; and developing and monitoring our general approach to corporate governance issues as they may arise. The Board has determined that each member of the corporate governance and nominating committee is “independent,” as that term is defined by the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.   Investment Committee   Our board of directors has appointed an Investment Committee currently consisting of our Chief Executive Officer Gerard M. Jacobs, our President and Chief Financial Officer William C. Jacobs, and director Thomas W. Hines. Future acquisitions by the Company of direct equity ownership interests in any entity other than Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits will be subject to unanimous approval by such Investment Committee and to majority approval by the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that the requirement of unanimous approval by such Investment Committee will be terminated if the investors in the Series A Preferred Stock no longer hold 25% or more of their investment in the form of Preferred Stock or common stock of the Company following conversion, or if the Company’s common stock has closed at $10.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days and there have been on average at least 50,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days, or if 84 months have passed since the first date that this registration statement is effective.

Morrissy each were granted the right to purchase from Acquired Sales, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.00: (1) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 25,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share expiring on December 31, 2024, and (2) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 25,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $1.85 per share expiring on December 31, 2024.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis   Employment Agreements   At December 31, 2018, we had no full-time paid employees and has not yet entered into long term executive or non-executive employment agreements, so as to limit the Company’s exposure and liability. William C. Jacobs, previously an independent contractor and now our President and Chief Financial Officer, is paid $5,000 per month on a part-time basis. As indicated elsewhere in this prospectus, the Company regularly engages outside consultants, accountants, independent contractors and other professional service providers for purposes of providing services to the Company. The Company endeavors, where able, to issue options in lieu of cash compensation, so as to preserve capital where needed and limit cash risk exposure.   Historically, funding for the Company was sourced from management affiliates and their contacts, who collectively loaned several hundred thousands of dollars in the past many years. The Company limits cash compensation to directors and does not have a cash compensation policy. The Company believes that, given the extensive experience of Mr. Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer, and the rest of the board of directors, and the current opportunity cost factor for each of them, as combined with the fact that each of them has continued to provide services without cash compensation, that the amount of historical compensation provided in the form of options and rights to purchase warrants to purchase shares of common stock is fair and reasonable for the Company.   Pursuant to the Compensation Agreement between the Company, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs entered into during June 2019, we expect to enter into multi-year employment agreements with Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs contingent upon the closing of the acquisition of either CBD Lion LLC or of Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids.    Compensation Committee   Our directors, Chief Executive Officer, and our President and Chief Financial Officer, do not receive remuneration from us unless approved by the Board of Directors, but we expect to enter into employment agreements with officers in the future pursuant to the  42  Compensation Agreement. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving us in any other capacity and receiving compensation in connection with that service. We have a compensation committee consisting of Joshua A. Bloom, M.D., Thomas W. Hines, Michael D. McCaffrey, Vincent J. Mesolella and Richard E. Morrissy as members. Joshua A. Bloom, M.D. serves as the committee’s chairman.   Long-Term Incentive Plans   Except for the incentives set out in the Compensation Agreement in favor of our Chief Executive Officer, and our President/Chief Financial Officer, there are no current arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers, except that our directors and executive officers may receive stock options at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We do not have any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of our Board.   Except for the incentives set out in the Compensation Agreement in favor of our Chief Executive Officer, and our President/Chief Financial Officer, we have no current plans or arrangements in respect of remuneration received or that may be received by our executive officers to compensate such officers in the event of termination of employment (as a result of resignation, retirement, change of control) or a change of responsibilities following a change of control, where the value of such compensation exceeds $60,000 per executive officer.

Sales Prices (1)      High   Low    Year 2019                2nd Quarter   $ 13.50   $ 1.62    1st Quarter   $ 1.75   $ 1.31                     Year Ended December 31, 2018                4th Quarter   $ 1.80   $ 0.27    3rd Quarter   $ 0.47   $   0.20    2nd Quarter   $  0.30   $   0.15    1st Quarter   $ 0.43   $ 0.30                     Year Ended December 31, 2017                4th Quarter   $ 0.66   $ 0.40    3rd Quarter   $ 0.55   $ 0.40    2nd Quarter   $ 1.18   $ 0.55    1st Quarter   $ 1.10   $ 0.52       (1)The above table sets forth the range of high and low closing sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by Google Finance, Yahoo! Finance or Barchart.com for the periods indicated.    Shareholders   As of July 26, 2019, there were an estimated 243 holders of record of our common stock. A certain amount of the shares of common stock are held in street name and may, therefore, be held by additional beneficial owners.   Dividends   We have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock since inception. The payment of dividends may be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon, but is not limited to, our operations, capital requirements, and overall financial condition.   We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. We intend to follow a policy of retaining all of our earnings to finance the development and execution of our strategy and the expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will occur only if our stock price appreciates.

On July 18, 2018 and November 8, 2018, Gerard M. Jacobs, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, loaned the Company $4,765.70 and $6,000, respectively, for working capital needs. The loans bear interest at 15% per annum.

Investment in Series A Preferred Stock   On February 27, 2019, director Thomas W. Hines purchased 5,400 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock convertible into 540,000 shares of our common stock at $1.00 per share.    Acquisition of Real Estate in Rhode Island    As discussed in our prior public filings, we have attempted to acquire one or more parcels of real estate in Rhode Island, referred to as the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties that are owned by entities affiliated with Vincent J. Mesolella and his son Derek V. Mesolella, formerly an independent contractor to the Company. One of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties is also partly owned by an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs. Discussions among Messrs. Mesolella and Jacobs and our independent directors have made it highly likely that we will never purchase any of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties.   Indemnification of Officers and Directors   Our bylaws specifically limit the liability of our Chief Executive Officer and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. As a result, aggrieved parties may have a more limited right to action than they would have had if such provisions were not present. The bylaws also provide for indemnification of our Chief Executive Officer and directors for any losses or liabilities they may incur as a result of the manner in which they operated our business or conducted internal affairs, provided that in connection with these activities they acted in good faith and in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interest. In the ordinary course of business, we also may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, independent contractors and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third-parties. We may also agree to indemnify former officers, directors, employees and independent contractors of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies.  Director Independence We are not listed on a national exchange, such as NASDAQ, at this time. As such, we are not required to have independent directors. Our management believes that, consistent with Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules that a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.  Our management has reviewed the composition of our Board of Directors and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including  45  family relationships, our Board of Directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exceptions of Gerard M. Jacobs and Dr. James S. Jacobs, is an “independent director”.   PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS   The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of July 26, 2019 by:   •each of our named executive officers;  •each of our directors;  •all of our current directors and executive officers as a group; and  •each stockholder known by us to own beneficially more than five percent of our common stock.    Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities. Shares of common stock that may be acquired by an individual or group within 60 days of July 26, 2019, pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants, are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such individual or group, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person shown in the table. Percentage of ownership is based on 2,586,669 shares of common stock outstanding on July 26, 2019.   Except as indicated in footnotes to this table, we believe that the stockholders named in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown to be beneficially owned by them, based on information provided to us by such stockholders.

The Series A Preferred Stock dividends are cumulative if we do not have the necessary cash to pay the dividend when due. The Series A Preferred Stock dividends shall cease to accrue at such time as our Common Stock has closed at $3.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days after the first date that this registration statement is effective, and there have been, on average, at least 25,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days. The Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have voluntary conversion rights. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock are subject to Mandatory Conversion (in the discretion of the Company) at such time as our Common Stock has closed at $5.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days after the first date that this registration statement is effective, and there have been, on average, at least 50,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days.     Series B Preferred Stock   On June 28, 2019, we commenced an offering, on an any-or-all basis, to sell shares of preferred stock strictly to purchasers who are verified accredited investors pursuant to the safe-harbor exemption set out in Regulation D, Rule 506(c). The offering contemplates the sale of restricted “Series B Preferred Stock”. We have designated 5,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The principal amount of the offering is $25,000,000, which may be increased by any amount in the sole discretion of the Company. The proposed primary terms of the Series B Preferred Stock include a $5.00 per share purchase price, conversion rights into one share of common stock for each share of Series B preferred stock, and dividends at the rate of 3% annually. The proposed Series B Preferred Stock dividends are cumulative if the Company does not have the necessary cash to pay the dividend when due. The proposed Series B Preferred Stock dividends shall cease to accrue at such time as the Company’s Common Stock has closed at $7.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days after the first date that the registration statement is effective, and there have been, on average, at least 25,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days. The proposed Series B Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights. The holders of the proposed Series B Preferred Stock shall have voluntary conversion rights. Shares of the proposed Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to Mandatory Conversion (in the discretion of the Company) at such time as the Company’s Common Stock has closed at $9.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days after the first date that the registration statement is effective, and there have been, on average, at least 50,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days. As of July 26, 2019, we have accepted a subscription from one accredited investor in a private placement to purchase 60,000 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000 in cash, convertible at the option of the holder into 60,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Company, or $5.00 per share of common stock of the Company.   Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to the 9,873,850 balance of 10,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change of control or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock, and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock.    Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans   None.   Warrants   As of July 26, 2019, there are outstanding warrants to purchase up to 4,376,869 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.19 per share. 49    Anti-Takeover Effects   Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and the Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”) may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect. Such provisions may delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in that stockholder’s best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders.   The NRS permits, if authorized by the Articles of Incorporation, the issuance of Blank Check Preferred Stock with preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by a corporation’s board of directors without stockholder approval.   Our Articles of Incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of Blank Check Preferred Stock, of which 9,873,850 preferred shares are available for future issuance in one or more series to be issued from time to time.   Each of the foregoing may have the effect of preventing or rendering more difficult or costly, the completion of a takeover transaction that stockholders might view as being in their best interests.   Potential Effects of Authorized but Unissued Stock   We have shares of common stock and preferred stock available for future issuance without stockholder approval. We may utilize these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, to facilitate corporate acquisitions or payment as a dividend on the capital stock.   The existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could render more difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, thereby protecting the continuity of our management. In addition, the Board of Directors has the discretion to determine designations, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of each series of preferred stock, all to the fullest extent permissible under the Nevada Law and subject to any limitations set forth in our Articles of Incorporation, as amended. The purpose of authorizing the board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences applicable to such preferred stock is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible financings, acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.     Board of Directors Vacancies   Our bylaws authorize our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy occurring on the board by a majority of the remaining members of the Board of Directors.   No Cumulative Voting. The Nevada Law provides that stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation\\\\\\'s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting.   Transfer Agent   The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Colonial Stock Transfer Company, Inc. Its address is 66 Exchange Place, 1st floor, Salt Lake City, UT 84111 and its telephone number is 801-355-5740.   Listing   Our common stock is traded on the OTC PINK under the symbol AQSP.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         Page             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-1  Balance Sheets, December 31, 2018 and 2017 F-2  Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 F-3  Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 F-4  Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 F-5  Notes to the Financial Statement F-6-F14     Condensed Balance Sheets, March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) and December 31, 2018 F-15  Condensed Statements of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 (Unaudited) F-16  Condensed Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit) for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 (Unaudited) F-17  Condensed Statement of Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 (Unaudited) F-18  Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) F-19   1   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Acquired Sales Corp.   Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Acquired Sales Corp. (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related statements of operations, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a history of recurring losses and does not have any business or sources of revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.       We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.   Spokane, Washington  March 11, 2019 1  ACQUIRED SALES CORP.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation – Acquired Sales Corp. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Acquired Sales”, the “Company”, “AQSP”, “Acquired”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986.    The Company currently is a shell corporation and does not currently have any business or any sources of revenue.   The Company wants to acquire all or a portion of one or more operating businesses.    Management of the Company currently is exclusively exploring potential acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products such as beverages, muscle/joint rubs, oils, crystals, tinctures, bath bombs, isolate, relief balms, elixirs, body washes, med sticks, lotions, vape pens and cartridges, shatter, and gummies (a “CBD-Infused Products Company”).    In order to consummate a particular acquisition of a CBD-Infused Products Company, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are related to such CBD-Infused Products Company, for example operating businesses and/or assets involving distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, paraphernalia, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-infused products, and real estate.    Execution of Stock Purchase Agreement  to Purchase up to 19.99% of CBD-Infused Beverage Maker Ablis, and of Craft Distillers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits   On February 27, 2019, the Company signed a Stock Purchase Agreement to purchase up to 19.99% of the common stock of CBD-infused beverage maker Ablis Inc. (formerly Ablis LLC) (www.AblisBev.com), and of craft distillers Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits (www.CraterLakeSpirits.com) and Bend Spirits, Inc. (www.Bendistillery.com), Bend, Oregon, for a total of $7,596,200 in cash.   Founded in 1996, Bendistillery is America\\\\\\'s most award winning craft distillery, with an outstanding reputation for producing Crater Lake Spirits brands including vodkas, gins, whiskeys, and white label brands offered through Bend Spirits.    Ablis is a rapidly growing leader in the exciting CBD-infused beverage industry. Ablis\\\\\\' all-natural, shelf-stable, GMO-free, non-alcoholic, lemon ginger, cranberry blood orange, and 0 calorie lemon water beverages target the mainstream health market and contain no THC. Ablis also manufactures and sells CBD-infused rubs, oils and crystals. Ablis\\\\\\' beverages are now being distributed in 11 states, online throughout the country, Puerto Rico and Guam. Also, Ablis has recently received state approval to co-brand with a local brewery in Bend to produce Oregon\\\\\\'s first hemp CBD-infused draft beer.    Closing of the purchase is subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of mutually acceptable due diligence, completion of a capital raise, execution of definitive documentation, obtaining necessary third party approvals, and completion of all necessary securities filings.   The Company expects to close the purchase in tranches, starting with a first tranche purchase of 4.99% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits for an aggregate purchase price of $1,896,200. The Company has raised sufficient capital through the sale of convertible preferred stock to allow the Company to close this first tranche purchase, and this first tranche purchase is expected to close during March 2019.    Following the expected closing of this first tranche purchase of 4.99% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, the Company desires to purchase up to an additional 15% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits under the Stock Purchase Agreement, but doing so will only be possible if the Company closes on the sale of additional preferred stock or otherwise raises capital, and receives approval to do so from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.  6  The stock purchase will make capital available for expanded off-line and online advertising, additional staff and equipment, and repayment of debt, for Bendistillery, Bend Spirits, and Ablis.    The management teams of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits will continue to lead their respective companies following the closing of the transaction. Gerard M. Jacobs, CEO of the Company, will join the board of directors of each of the companies, and William C. Jacobs, CFO of the Company, will be paid quarterly by the companies in regard to financial oversight of the companies.   Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) typically requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.   Cash and Cash Equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 included cash on-hand. Cash equivalents are considered all accounts with an original maturity date within 90 days. Cash equivalents are carried at cost.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying amount of the financial instruments, which principally include cash, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximates fair value due to the relative short maturity of such instruments.    Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair-value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value as follows:   Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities    Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quotes prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.    Income Taxes – Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided on differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and on tax carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred income tax assets when it is not more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized.   Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is determined by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. When dilutive, the incremental potential common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants are determined by the treasury stock method. The following table summarizes the calculations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: 7      For the Year Ended      December 31,       2018   2017  Net Loss   $ (220,621)     $ (80,033)    Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding   2,369,648      2,369,648                Basic and Diluted Earnings Loss per Share   $ (0.09)     $ (0.03)       At December 31, 2018, there were outstanding options to purchase 1,186,132 shares of common stock at between $0.001 and $0.60 per share, (b) rights to purchase warrants to purchase 2,950,000 shares of common stock at between $0.01 and $1.85 per share, and (c) financing warrants to purchase 37,500 shares of common stock at $0.03. As of the date of this report, none of these outstanding options, rights to purchase warrants or financing warrants have been exercised into shares of common stock. However, all of them may be exercised at any time in the sole discretion of the holder except for the rights to purchase warrants to purchase 1.25 million shares of our commons stock, are not exercisable until a performance contingency is met.   In comparison, at December 31, 2017, there were 1,358,774 stock options and rights to purchase warrants to purchase 2,700,000 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share because their effects would have been anti-dilutive.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Effective January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 “Statement of Cash Flows” (Topic 230). This guidance clarifies diversity in practice on where in the Statement of Cash Flows to recognize certain transactions, including the classification of payment of contingent consideration for acquisitions between Financing and Operating activities. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our financial statements.   On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Clarifying the Definition of a Business” (Topic ASC 805), guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a “set”) is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, the amendments require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace the missing elements. This ASU is effective for public business entities in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our financial statements.   In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) - Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This ASU is effective prospectively for the annual period ending December 31, 2018 and interim periods within that annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our financial statements.   In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to improve the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements while reducing cost and complexity in financial reporting. Under the new standard, nonemployee share-based payment awards within the scope of Topic 718 are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that an entity is obligated to issue when conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. These equity-classified non-employee share-based payment awards are measured at the grant date. Consistent with the accounting for employee share-based payment awards, an entity considers the probability of satisfying performance conditions when  8  nonemployee share-based payment awards contain such conditions. The new standard also eliminates the requirement to reassess classification of such awards upon vesting. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our financial statements.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements – We have no off balance sheet arrangements.   NOTE 2 - RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES   Going Concern – The Company has a history of recurring losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $14,005,689 as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a net loss of $220,621.    The Company currently is a shell corporation and does not have any business or any sources of revenue. As a result, there is substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. Bankruptcy of the Company at some point in the future is a possibility. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   The Company currently has no revenue-generating subsidiaries. Management plans to sustain the Company as a going concern by taking the following actions: (1) acquiring and/or developing profitable businesses that will create positive income from operations; and/or (2) completing private placements of the Company’s common stock and/or preferred stock. Management believes that by taking these actions, the Company will be provided with sufficient future operations and cash flow to continue as a going concern. However, there can be no assurances or guarantees whatsoever that the Company will be successful in consummating such actions on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, any such actions can be expected to result in substantial dilution to the existing shareholders of the Company.   NOTE 3 – NOTES RECEIVABLE   The William Noyes Webster Foundation, Inc.   The Foundation, a non-profit Massachusetts corporation, has received a provisional registration from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to own and operate a medical marijuana cultivation facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and a medical marijuana dispensary in Dennis, Massachusetts. Jane W. Heatley (“Heatley”) is the founder and a member of the board of directors of the Foundation.   Teaming Agreement – The Company believes it is highly likely that the board of directors of the Foundation will only approve contracts that have been negotiated and approved by Heatley. Consequently, on July 8, 2014, the Company entered into a Teaming Agreement (the \"Teaming Agreement\") with Heatley, in which, among other things: (1) the Company and Heatley agreed to use their respective best efforts, working exclusively together as a team, and not as a partnership or other entity, in order to consummate transactions, agreements, contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which the Company will provide capital and expertise to the Foundation; and (2) Heatley agreed that Heatley shall not, and shall not permit the Foundation to, discuss or negotiate for debt or equity financing, or consulting services or other expertise, from any third party. The Company claims that Heatley violated the Teaming Agreement by discussing and negotiating for debt or equity financing, or consulting services or other expertise, from at least one third party. Heatley claims that the Company violated the Teaming Agreement alleging that the Company failed to lend funds to the Foundation in accordance with the Teaming Agreement. The Company believes Heatley\\\\\\'s claim to be baseless. No assurances whatsoever can be made that Heatley will comply with the terms of the Teaming Agreement, nor that the Company will be able to adequately enforce the terms of the Teaming Agreement if it is ever the subject of litigation.   Promissory Note – On July 14, 2014, the Foundation signed and delivered to the Company a Secured Promissory Note (the \"Note\") which is in the stated loan amount of $1,500,000, and is secured by a Security Agreement of even date therewith (the “Security Agreement”). The Note provides that the $1,500,000 loan may be advanced in one or more installments as the Foundation and the Company may mutually agree upon. The Foundation and the Company mutually agreed that the first installment of this loan would be $602,500. Pursuant to instructions from the Foundation, on July 14, 2014, the Company paid $2,500 owed by the Foundation to one of its consultants, and the  9  Company advanced $600,000 directly to the Foundation. The amount and timing of subsequent loan installments under the Note, which could have totaled $897,500, had not yet been mutually agreed upon between the Foundation and the Company as of the date of the Note.    Between April and July 2015, the Company loaned an additional $135,350 to the Foundation, evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Agreement. Following such additional loans, the principal of the loan from the Company to the Foundation, evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Agreement, is now $737,850. The principal balance outstanding under the Note bore interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum, compounded monthly. It was contemplated that the first payment of accrued interest by the Foundation under the Note would be made as soon after the Foundation commences operations of the Plymouth Cultivation Facility and the Dennis Dispensary as the Foundation\\\\\\'s cash flows shall reasonably permit, but in any event no later than one year after the Foundation commences operations. The principal of the Note would be payable in eight consecutive equal quarterly installments, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Foundation commences operations. Principal on the Note and related accrued interest would be considered past due if the aforementioned payments were not received by their due dates.   Uncollectable Note and Interest Receivable – The Company assessed the collectability of the Note based on the adequacy of the Foundation’s collateral and the Foundation’s capability of repaying the Note according to its terms. Based on this assessment, on September 1, 2015, the Company concluded that Note and interest receivable would not be collectible. As such, the Company wrote off the Note totaling $737,850 and interest receivable totaling $97,427 as bad debt expense on September 1, 2015.   NOTE 4 – AMOUNTS OWED TO RELATED PARTIES    On June 21, 2016, a company affiliated with Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer of Acquired Sales, made a non-interest bearing loan of $4,000 to the Company, which is payable upon demand.    At December 31, 2018, there are expense reimbursements owed to Gerard M. Jacobs totaling $24,583. In comparison, at December 31, 2017, there were expense reimbursements owed to Gerard M. Jacobs totaling $13,841.   At December 31, 2018, there are independent contractor fees of $160,000 and expense reimbursements of $4,417 owed to William C. Jacobs totaling $164,417. In comparison, at December 31, 2017, there were independent contractor fees of $100,000 and expense reimbursements of $3,907 owed to William C. Jacobs totaling $103,907. William C. Jacobs is the son of Gerard M. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer of Acquired Sales, and the nephew of director James S. Jacobs.   Financing Warrants – On July 13, 2018, the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and full Board of Directors of AQSP approved by unanimous written consent borrowings by AQSP on the following terms:(1) proceeds of the borrowings will be used to pay professional fees owed to our outside auditors, our stock transfer agent, and our securities counsel, and to pay other obligations of AQSP; (2) the borrowings will be evidenced by promissory notes of AQSP, accruing interest at the rate of 15% annually; (3) the notes will be jointly secured by a first lien security interest in all of the assets of AQSP, pursuant to a security agreement signed by AQSP in favor of the lenders, UCC filings in favor of the lenders, and a pledge to the lenders of the note payable by the William Noyes Webster Foundation Inc. to AQSP; (4) the notes shall be due and payable upon demand by the lenders delivered to AQSP; and (5) for each $1,000 loaned by AQSP on these terms, the lender of such $1,000 shall receive warrants to purchase 1,250 shares of common stock of AQSP, at an exercise price of $0.03 per share, exercisable at the discretion of such lender any time on or before July 16, 2023.    As of December 31, 2018, a total of $30,791 has been borrowed by AQSP on such terms, and warrants to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock of AQSP have been issued to Joshua A. Bloom and warrants to purchase 12,500 shares of common stock of AQSP have been issued to Gerard M. Jacobs.    The warrants to purchase common stock that were issued to Joshua A. Bloom and Gerard M. Jacobs on July 16, 2018 and July 18, 2018 were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model as of the date they were issued. The values of these warrants were fully expensed because the notes are payable upon demand. The expense recognized related to the issuance of the warrants to Joshua A. Bloom on July 16, 2018 was $3,250. Gerard M. Jacobs’ warrants were issued to him on July 18, 2018, and the expense recognized related to the issuance of these warrants was $1,300. 10  The warrants to purchase common stock that were issued to Gerard M. Jacobs on November 8, 2018, and to Joshua A. Bloom on November 12, 2018, were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which incorporated the following assumptions: expected future stock volatility 465%; risk-free interest rates of 2.98% and 2.94%, respectively; dividend yield of 0% and an expected terms of 2.38 years and 2.37 years, respectively. The expected future stock volatility was based on the volatility of Acquired Sales Corp.’s historical stock prices. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Federal treasury rate for instruments due over the expected term of the warrants. The expected term of each warrant was based on the midpoint between the date the warrant vests and the contractual term of the warrant. The values of the warrants were fully expensed as of the date of issuance because they are payable upon demand. The expense recognized related to the issuance of the warrants to Gerard M. Jacobs on November 8, 2018 was $11,250. The expense recognized related to the issuance of the warrants to Joshua A. Bloom on November 12, 2018 was $21,874.    NOTE 5 – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY    Share-Based Compensation – Share-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $72,500 and $0, respectively.    The following is a summary of share-based compensation, stock option and warrant activity as of December 31, 2018 and changes during the year then ended:     Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price (a) Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value  Outstanding, December 31, 2017 4,058,774    $ 1.29    5.59    $ 577,725     Rights to Purchase Warrants Issued During Period 250,000           Financing Warrants Issued During Period 37,500           Options Expired During Period 172,642           Options, Rights to Purchase Warrants and Financing Warrants Outstanding, December 31, 2018 4,173,632    $ 1.16    4.95    $ 2,410,100     Exercisable Options, Rights to Purchase Warrants and Financing Warrants Outstanding, December 31, 2018 2,923,632    $ 0.87    4.93    $ 2,410,100                Note:          (a) The Weighted-Average Exercise Price column excludes those warrants that have an exercise price for the common stock priced at the Capital Raise Price Per Share.     Rights to Purchase Warrants Issued During Period – On April 1, 2018, we issued to James S. Jacobs and to William C. Jacobs, an independent contractor, rights to purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.00, an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company (40,000 to James S. Jacobs, and 210,000 to William C. Jacobs), at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, such warrants to be fully vested and to be exercisable on or prior to December 31, 2024. We recorded total stock compensation expense of $72,500 related to these rights to purchase warrants; this consists of $11,600 of stock compensation for the rights to purchase warrants issued to James S. Jacobs, and $60,900 of stock compensation for the rights to purchase warrants issued to William C. Jacobs. On October 1, 2018, William C. Jacobs assigned rights to purchase warrants to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock to a separate entity.   NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES   On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, broadened the  11  corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions, and credits, limited the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct interest expense, and transitioned to a territorial tax system which allows for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. with a 100% federal dividends received deduction prospectively. In addition, the Tax Act required a one-time transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings. Several of the new provisions enacted as part of the Tax Act require clarification and guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and Treasury Department. These or other changes in U.S. tax laws could impact our profits, effective tax rate, and cash flows.   During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not incur any current tax on its continuing operations and there was no deferred tax provision or benefit from continuing operations. At December 31, 2018, the Company has U.S. Federal net operating loss carry forwards of $2,115,050 that will expire in 2030 through 2034 if not used by those dates.   As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate over the next 12 months. The Company currently believes that all significant filing positions are highly certain and that all of its significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon audit. Therefore, the Company has no significant reserves for uncertain tax positions and no adjustments to such reserves were required by generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination for the years ended December 31, 2013 through 2017. A reconciliation of the amount of tax benefit computed using the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations is as follows:         For the Years Ended         December 31,         2018 2017  Tax expenses (benefit) at statutory rate (21%) $ (46,330)   $ (27,211)    State tax benefit, net of federal benefit $ -    (2,641)    Non-deductible expenses   $ 276    40     Revision of prior years\\\\\\' deferred tax assets $ (30,034)   67,252     Change in valuation allowance   $ (1,488,585)   (37,439)    Provision for Income Taxes   $ -    $ -          The tax effects of temporary differences and carry forwards that gave rise to the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:        December 31,       2018 2017  Operating loss carry forwards     $ 428,393      $ 676,116     Stock-based compensation     1,633,366      2,874,127     Other     131      233     Less: Valuation allowance     (2,061,891)     (3,550,475)    Net Deferred Income Tax Asset   $ -    $ -        The deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $1,488,585 and $37,439 during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.     NOTE 7 – CONTINGENT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS   The Board of Directors of the Company has committed to pay compensation to Gerard M. Jacobs, our Chief Executive Officer, as an inducement to him to introduce attractive acquisitions to the Company. The amount of the compensation will be 10% of the consideration paid by the Company to acquire equity ownership interests in target companies. The timing and structure of such compensation is currently expected to be determined pursuant to negotiations to be held between Gerard M. Jacobs and the chairman of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  12  NOTE 8 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    Additional Borrowings in Exchange for Notes, Accrued Interest and Financing Warrants   On July 13, 2018, the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and full Board of Directors of AQSP approved by unanimous written consent borrowings by AQSP on the following terms: (1) proceeds of the borrowings will be used to pay professional fees owed to our outside auditors, our stock transfer agent, and our securities counsel, and to pay other obligations of AQSP; (2) the borrowings will be evidenced by promissory notes of AQSP, accruing interest at the rate of 15% annually; (3) the notes will be jointly secured by a first lien security interest in all of the assets of AQSP, pursuant to a security agreement signed by AQSP in favor of the lenders, UCC filings in favor of the lenders, and a pledge to the lenders of the note payable by the William Noyes Webster Foundation Inc. to AQSP; (4) the notes shall be due and payable upon demand by the lenders delivered to AQSP; and (5) for each $1,000 loaned by AQSP on these terms, the lender of such $1,000 shall receive warrants to purchase 1,250 shares of common stock of AQSP, at an exercise price of $0.03 per share, exercisable at the discretion of such lender any time on or before July 16, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $30,791 was borrowed on these terms. Following the end of the period ended December 31, 2018, a total of $14,772 has been borrowed by AQSP on such terms.   Signing of a Definitive Stock Purchase Agreement with Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits   On February 27, 2019, the Company signed a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"SPA\") with Ablis, Bendistillery, Bend Spirits, Bendis Homes Pinehurst, LLC, James A. Bendis, Alan T. Dietrich, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. \"Jake\" Jacobs to purchase 4.99% of the common stock of Ablis for $399,200 in cash, to purchase 4.99% of the common stock of Bendistillery for $1,347,300 in cash, and to purchase 4.99% of the common stock of Bend Spirits for $149,700 in cash. The purchases are expected to close during March 2019. Under the SPA the Company will have the right to purchase up to an additional 15% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits.   Acceptance of Subscriptions From Accredited Investors to Purchase Newly Issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock   On February 27, 2019, the Company accepted subscriptions from accredited investors to purchase 23,400 shares of newly issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Preferred Stock\") for an aggregate purchase price of $2,340,000 in cash. These 23,400 shares of Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holders into 2,340,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Company, or $1.00 per share of common stock of the Company. The Company has committed to file a registration statement covering the shares of newly issued common stock of the Company into which the Preferred Stock can be converted (the \"Registration Statement\"). The Preferred Stock will receive an annual dividend, and will be subject to mandatory conversion, under terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation of the Preferred Stock.   Newly Elected Director of the Company: Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA   Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA, a Vice President of Lowery Asset Consulting in Chicago, has been elected to serve as a Director of the Company. 13  William C. \"Jake\" Jacobs, CPA: Elected to serve as the President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company   William C. \"Jake\" Jacobs, CPA, the son of our Company\\\\\\'s Chief Executive Officer Gerard M. Jacobs, has been elected to serve as the President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company. Gerard M. Jacobs will remain as the Company\\\\\\'s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary.   Establishment of an Investment Committee   The Board of Directors of the Company has voted to establish an Investment Committee, the initial members of which will be Gerard M. Jacobs, William C. \"Jake\" Jacobs, CPA, and Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA. Future acquisitions by the Company of direct equity ownership interests in any entity other than Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits will be subject to unanimous approval by such Investment Committee and to majority approval by the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that the requirement of unanimous approval by such Investment Committee will be terminated if the investors in the Preferred Stock no longer hold 25% or more of their investment in the form of Preferred Stock or common stock of the Company following conversion, or if the Company\\\\\\'s common stock has closed at $10.00 per share or higher for 20 consecutive trading days and there have been on average at least 50,000 shares traded on each of those 20 consecutive trading days, or if 84 months have passed since the first date that the Registration Statement is effective. 14  ACQUIRED SALES CORP.

Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)   NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRED SALES CORP.   Acquired Sales Corp. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Acquired Sales”, the “Company”, “AQSP”, “Acquired”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986. The Company does not currently have any business or any sources of revenue.   The Company wants to acquire all or a portion of one or more operating businesses.   Management of the Company currently is exclusively exploring potential acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products such as beverages, muscle/joint rubs, oils, crystals, tinctures, bath bombs, isolate, relief balms, elixirs, body washes, med sticks, lotions, vape pens and cartridges, shatter, and gummies (a “CBD-Infused Products Company”).   In order to consummate a particular acquisition of a CBD-Infused Products Company, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are related to such CBD-Infused Products Company, for example operating businesses and/or assets involving distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, paraphernalia, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-infused products, and real estate.    Signing of Letter of Intent to Acquire 100% of the Ownership Interests of CBD Lion LLC   On May 8, 2019, Acquired Sales Corp. (the “Company”), Gerard M. Jacobs (“GJacobs”) and William C. “Jake” Jacobs (“WJacobs”) entered into a Letter of Intent with CBD Lion LLC (“Lion”) and its owners (the “Lion Owners”) to, subject to a number of conditions, acquire 100% of the ownership of Lion (the “Transaction”). The consideration to be paid by the Company in the proposed acquisition of Lion is: two million dollars ($2,000,000) in cash, plus unregistered common stock of the Company (the \"Stock Consideration\") in an amount that is the greater of: (i) five million (5,000,000) shares or (ii) a number of shares with a value at closing of the Transaction, based on the Company’s share price, equal to 50% of the value of the aggregate consideration deemed paid to the Lion Owners for their ownership interests in Lion, which could hypothetically increase the Stock Consideration to a number significantly higher than five million (5,000,000). The Lion Owners shall have \"piggyback registration rights\" for the common stock shares underlying the Stock Consideration and \"demand registration rights\" that are triggered if no registration statement covering the Stock Consideration is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days following the closing of the Transaction. In addition, the Letter of Intent requires that at the closing of the Transaction, the Company shall cause up to four hundred sixty-two thousand four hundred thirty dollars ($462,430) of related party debt owed by Lion to be repaid in full.    The terms of the proposed Transaction must be set forth in a definitive agreement. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in negotiating an acceptable definitive agreement, when or whether a definitive agreement will be reached between the parties, or that the proposed Transaction will be consummated. Even if a definitive agreement is executed, the terms of the proposed Transaction may change materially from the terms set forth in the Letter of Intent. There will be many conditions to closing of the Transaction, many of which are outside of the parties’ control and we cannot predict whether these conditions will be satisfied. There are no assurances when or if closing of the Transaction will occur, even if the parties successfully negotiate and sign a definitive agreement.   Closing of the acquisition of Lion is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to the completion of due diligence investigation of Lion by the Company that is acceptable to the Company, completion of a capital raise by the Company of at least $4 million, completion of an audit of Lion acceptable to the Company, execution of definitive acquisition documents, execution of employment agreements with certain key Lion executives, obtaining necessary third-party approvals, including a tax opinion to be provided by Lion’s tax counsel indicating that the proposed Transaction will qualify as a tax-free reorganization, and completion of all necessary securities filings. In the event that most of the foregoing conditions are met, as detailed in the Letter of Intent, prior to the closing of the proposed Transaction, the Company will make a $300,000 loan to Lion to be used by Lion exclusively for growth capital. 19    The Company is currently engaged in due diligence of Lion and has not yet started to negotiate a definitive agreement for the proposed Transaction. The Letter of Intent will terminate if (i) no audit of Lion satisfactory to the Company has been delivered by August 31, 2019; the Company fails to raise $4 million by September 30, 2019; or (iii) the proposed Transaction has not closed by October 31, 2019.   The Letter of Intent contains customary provisions prohibiting Lion from soliciting or encouraging any other acquisition proposal or entering into any negotiations or agreements for an alternative acquisition or financing transaction prior to the termination of the Letter of Intent.   In the event that the proposed acquisition of Lion is completed, the Letter of Intent requires that as soon as practicable following the closing of the proposed sale, the Company will change its name to \"CBD Lion Corp.” and request a new trading symbol that better relates to the new proposed name.   Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement - Ablis Holding Company   Ablis Holding Company (\"Ablis\") is a rapidly growing leader in the exciting CBD-infused beverage industry. Ablis\\\\\\' all-natural, shelf-stable, GMO-free, non-alcoholic, lemon ginger, cranberry blood orange, and 0 calorie lemon water beverages target the mainstream health market and contain no THC. Ablis also manufactures and sells CBD-infused rubs, oils and crystals. Ablis\\\\\\' beverages are now being distributed in 11 states, online throughout the country, Puerto Rico and Guam. Also, Silver Moon Brewing, a brewery in Bend, has recently begun producing and selling Hazibliss, Oregon’s first hemp CBD-infused draft beer that incorporates Ablis’ cranberry blood orange CBD beverage.   On April 30, 2019, the Company, GJacobs, and WJacobs entered into a Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement with Ablis, Ablis, Inc., and James A. Bendis (“Bendis”) wherein the Company paid $399,200 for a post transaction 4.99% ownership of Ablis\\\\\\' equity. Ablis is in the business of manufacturing and sale of CBD-infused beverages, and CBD-infused products. The Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement requires that Ablis use a portion of the purchase proceeds to pay off at least $381,000 of its liabilities. Another portion of the purchase proceeds will make capital available for expanded off-line and online advertising, and additional staff and equipment.   The Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement also sets out terms for an additional equity purchase of Ablis such that the Company may purchase up to an additional 15% of Ablis for $1,200,000 so that the Company would then own 19.99% of the ownership equity of Ablis. The Company desires to purchase up to an additional 15% of the common stock of Ablis, but doing so will only be possible if the Company closes on the sale of additional Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Preferred Stock\") or otherwise raises capital.   The management team of Ablis will continue to lead Ablis. The terms of the Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement entitle GJacobs to be a member of the board of directors of Ablis, entitles WJacobs, to be provided with access to Ablis\\\\\\' financial information, grants WJacobs, financial oversight functions over Ablis, and allows WJacobs the right to provide consulting/advisory services to Ablis. WJacobs’ reasonable expenses will be covered by Ablis. The Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement also requires that GJacobs and WJacobs be introduced to the owners of Ablis’ CBD isolate suppliers, and any other companies in the hemp, CBD and cannabis industries with whom Ablis and/or Bendis have relationships, and whom may potentially be interested in entering into a stock sale or merger with the Company.   The Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement requires that Ablis evaluate and seriously consider a sale of Ablis or taking Ablis public within 60 months from April 30, 2019 and that it use commercially reasonable best efforts, to close a mutually acceptable alternative exit opportunity for the Company within 72 months from April 30, 2019.   The Company’s investment in Ablis made the Company a minority owner of Ablis. As a minority owner, the Company will not be able to recognize any portion of Ablis’ revenues or earnings in the Company’s financial statements. The Company may, at some point, receive commissions for helping to sell Ablis\\\\\\' products either online or offline. The Company’s investment in Ablis will be tested for potential impairment of value on a quarterly basis.   Stock Purchase Agreement - Bendistillery Inc. and Bend Spirits, Inc.   20  Founded in 1996, Bendistillery Inc. (\"Bendistillery\") is an award-winning craft distillery, with an outstanding reputation for producing Crater Lake Spirits brands including vodkas, gins, whiskeys, and white label brands offered through Bend Spirits, Inc. (\"Bend Spirits\").   On April 30, 2019, the Company, GJacobs, and WJacobs entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Bendistillery, Bend Spirits, Bendis Homes Pinehurst, LLC, an Oregon limited liability company (“Landowner”), Bendis, and Alan T. Dietrich (“Dietrich”) wherein the Company paid $1,347,300 for a post transaction 4.99% ownership of Bendistillery’s equity and $149,700 for a post transaction 4.99% ownership of Bend Spirits’ equity. Bendistillery and Bend Spirits are in the business of manufacturing and sale of alcoholic beverages, and the manufacturing of CBD-infused beverages and CBD-infused products. The Stock Purchase Agreement requires that Bendistillery and Bend Spirits use a portion of the purchase proceeds to pay off at least $835,000 of their collective liabilities. Another portion of the purchase proceeds will make capital available for expanded off-line and online advertising, and additional staff and equipment.   The Stock Purchase Agreement also sets out terms for an additional equity purchase of Bendistillery such that the Company may purchase up to an additional 15% of Bendistillery for $4,050,000 so that the Company would then own 19.99% of the ownership equity of Bendistillery. Per the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company may also purchase up to an additional 15% of Bend Spirits for $450,000 such that the Company would then own 19.99% of the ownership equity of Bend Spirits. The Company desires to purchase up to an additional 15% of the common stock of each of Bendistillery and Bend Spirits under the Stock Purchase Agreement, but doing so will only be possible if the Company closes on the sale of additional Preferred Stock or otherwise raises capital, and receives approval to do so from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.   Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Landowner (as landlord) and Bendistillery (as tenant) have entered into a long-term lease of the 23 acres in Tumalo outside Bend, Oregon, where Bendistillery and Bend Spirits conduct their businesses (the “Real Estate”), which lease (the “Lease”) is consistent with the following terms: the initial term of the Lease is 20 years at a rent of $17,500 per month; Tenant has the right, in its sole discretion, to exercise a series of options to extend the term of the Lease up to a maximum of 99 years; and Tenant has a 60-day right of first refusal if Landowner ever decides to sell all or any portion of the Real Estate. Bendis is the owner of Landowner.   The management teams of Bendistillery and Bend Spirits will continue to lead their respective companies. The terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement entitle GJacobs to be a member of the board of directors of Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, entitle WJacobs to be provided with access to financial information, grants WJacobs financial oversight functions over Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, and allows WJacobs the right to provide consulting/advisory services to Bendistillery and Bend Spirits. WJacobs’ reasonable expenses will be covered by Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, as well as an advisory fee of not less than $5,000 per quarter. The Stock Purchase Agreement also requires that GJacobs and WJacobs be introduced to the owners of Deschutes Brewery, Silver Moon Brewing, LBD Beverage, and any other companies in the distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, CBD and cannabis industries with whom Bendistillery, Bend Spirits, Bendis and/or Dietrich have relationships, and whom may potentially be interested in entering into a stock sale or merger with the Company.   The Stock Purchase Agreement requires that Bendistillery and Bend Spirits evaluate and seriously consider a sale of Bendistillery and Bend Spirits or taking them public within 60 months from April 30, 2019 and that they use commercially reasonable best efforts to close a mutually acceptable alternative exit opportunity for the Company within 72 months from April 30, 2019.   The Company’s investments in Bendistillery and Bend Spirits made the Company a minority owner of these companies. As a minority owner, the Company will not be able to recognize any portion of Bendistillery’s or Bend Spirits’ revenues or earnings in the Company’s financial statements. The Company may, at some point, receive commissions for helping sell Bendistillery’s products either online or offline. The Company’s investments in Bendistillery and Bend Spirits will be tested for potential impairment in value on a quarterly basis.   Acceptance of Subscriptions From Accredited Investors to Purchase Newly Issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock   Between February 27, 2019 and May 13, 2019, the Company accepted subscriptions from accredited investors to purchase 66,150 shares of newly issued Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $6,615,000 in cash. These 66,150 shares of Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holders into 6,615,000 shares of newly  21  issued common stock of the Company, or $1.00 per share of common stock of the Company. The Company has committed to file a registration statement covering the shares of newly issued common stock of the Company into which the Preferred Stock can be converted (the \"Registration Statement\"). The Preferred Stock will receive an annual dividend, and will be subject to mandatory conversion, under terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation of the Preferred Stock.   Acquisition Process   The structure of the Company’s participation in business opportunities and ventures will continue to be situational. The Company is likely to structure future acquisitions as a purchase of 19.99% or less, or 50.01% or more, of a target company’s equity ownership interest, or as a so-called tax-free reorganization. It is likely that the anticipated value of the business and/or securities that the Company acquires relative to the current value of the Company’s securities will result in the issuance of a relatively large number of newly issued shares of the Company, and, as a result, substantial additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our current stockholders. Moreover, the Company’s present management and shareholders may not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or purchase of stock. It is possible that the shareholders of the acquired entity or the persons who provide the capital to the Company to finance a merger or purchase of stock will gain control of the Company’s voting stock and the Company’s directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the shareholders. Those directors are entitled to replace the Company’s officers without stockholder vote.   In regard to nearly all of the Company’s potential acquisitions, the Company is typically focused upon acquiring 19.99% or less, or 50.01% or more, of existing privately held businesses whose owners are willing to consider selling a percentage of the equity ownership interest of their businesses, or merging their entire businesses into the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in a so-called tax-free reorganization, and whose management teams are enthusiastic about continuing to operate their businesses following the transactions with the Company.   Closing such purchases of stock or so-called tax-free reorganizations will likely require the Company to raise millions of dollars of capital, in order to pay the cash portion of the transaction consideration. The Company can provide no assurance or guaranty whatsoever that it will be able to raise such millions of dollars of capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.   An Investment Committee appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently consisting of GJacobs, director Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA, and WJacobs, CPA, will review material furnished to it and will vote whether or not the Investment Committee believes a potential acquisition is in the Company’s best interests and the interests of the Company’s shareholders. If the Investment Committee votes unanimously to approve a potential acquisition, then such acquisition will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Company for their review and a vote. The Company does not intend to proceed forward with a potential acquisition without the unanimous approval of the Investment Committee and approval by a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors.   The Company intends to source acquisition opportunities through its CEO and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include the shareholders of Ablis, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities may become available to us due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) The Company’s ownership of shares in one or more CBD-Infused Products Companies; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) the Company’s flexibility with respect to the manner in which the Company may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.   The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors. Inasmuch as the Company will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities, the Company will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. The Company will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by the Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.   22  In a due diligence investigation, the Company intends to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, the Company intends to cause the Investment Committee to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding the target businesses’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target businesses to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.   There is no guarantee that the Company can obtain or maintain the funding needed for its operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services.   As of May 13, 2019, the Company has cash on hand of approximately $4,379,077, which are proceeds from the sale of Preferred Stock between February 27, 2019 and May 13, 2019. In prior years, the Company’s payables have been greater than their cash on hand. The Company has inconsistent income generating ability and is therefore reliant on raising money from loans or stock sales.   NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation – The accompanying financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company for all periods presented.   Condensed Financial Statements – The accompanying financial statements are condensed and do not include all disclosures normally required by generally accepted accounting principles. These statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements included in Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2019. In particular, the basis of presentation and significant accounting principles were presented in Note 1 to the annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments, except as disclosed herein. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2019.   Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) typically requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. In the past, significant estimates included share-based compensation forfeiture rates and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized for financial reporting purposes. Actual results and outcomes may differ from our estimates and assumptions.   Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is determined by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. When dilutive, the incremental potential common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants are determined by the treasury stock method. The following table summarizes the calculations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018:       For the Three Months Ended      March 31,      2019   2018  Net Loss   $ (44,440)     $ (20,068)    Weighted Average Shares Outstanding   2,405,777      2,369,648                Basic and Diluted Loss per Share   $ (0.02)     $ (0.01)       At March 31, 2019, there were outstanding options to purchase 1,186,132 shares of common stock exercisable at between $0.001 and $3.18 per share, (b) rights to purchase warrants to purchase 2,740,000 shares of common stock  23  exercisable at between $0.01 and $1.85 per share, and (c) financing warrants to purchase 56,250 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.03 per share. As of the date of this report, none of these outstanding options, rights to purchase warrants or financing warrants have been exercised into shares of common stock. However, all of them may be exercised at any time in the sole discretion of the holder except for certain rights to purchase warrants to purchase 1.25 million shares of our commons stock, which are not exercisable until a performance contingency is met.

This summary does not contain all the information you should consider before investing in the securities. However, you should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.    Our Business   We are seeking to engage in the business of developing and marketing nutritional products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle. In this connection we intend to conduct research and development on our own proprietary products based on cordyceps sinensis. Cordyceps is a fungus that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis has been described as a medicine in old Chinese medical books and Tibetan medicine. It is a rare combination of a caterpillar and a fungus and found at altitudes above 4500m in Sikkim. According to the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, the fungus is parasitic in nature. The base of the mushroom first originates from an insect larval host and ends at the club-like cap, including the stipe and stroma. The fruit body is dark brown to black, and the root of organism, the larval body pervaded by the mycelium, is yellowish to brown color. The immature larvae (host) on which cordyceps grows usually lies about 6 inches below the surface of the ground. As the fungus approaches maturity, it consumes more than 90% of the infected insect effectively mummifying its host. Local folk practitioners use the product alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs to treat various diseases. However, the effectiveness of Cordyceps sinensis, either alone or with other medicinal herbs, has not been shown as effective in double blind tests, and it has not been subject to the type of testing that would be required for prescription medication. As a result, in the United States we cannot make any claims as to specific health benefits.   Prior to the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2017, we did not generate any revenue. We first sold products during the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2017. We generated revenues of $510,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1,445,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017. All sales, which were sales of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder, were made to one customer, all of our purchases were from one supplier and our gross margin on all of our revenues was 10%. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we generated net income of $80,227, and for the year ended September 30, 2017 we sustained a net loss of $2,248.
