## S-1 Document Clustering

Form S-1 is an SEC filing used by companies planning on going public. Companies are obligated to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the basic business and financial information for the specific offering. Investors often use the S-1 as a prospectus for research prior to the IPO. This is one of the most detailed registration forms filed to the SEC.

Understandably, these forms are highly scrutinized. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that to complete an S1 requires 972.32 hours of effort for the corporate registrant who intends to offer securities.

With the time and detailed required to complete the form, the SEC in turn must scrutinize submitted forms to ensure that they include the necessary information. Using topic modeling, I will categorize S-1 forms as an initial processor for the SEC.
